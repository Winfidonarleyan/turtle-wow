-- Fix typo in description of quest 60041.
UPDATE `quest_template` SET `Details`='This is outrageous! The nerve! First, they only sneak around and startle your herds. Then they sneak into your barn. And what\'s next?! Rob our houses? Kill us all in our sleep?! What do you think the guards do with this situation, hm? NOTHING!\n\nThese gnolls are getting bolder with each week and we need our fields protected! Guards are of no help here, unfortunately for us, but I see you have some of that bristling force in your sights. Perhaps you\'ll be able to help me and in the end help yourself too!\n\nLast I\'ve seen these mongrels fly away toward Goldshire. Doubt guards will be of any help on this matter. Perhaps someone at the Eastvale Logging Camp could help with our troubleâ€¦ Ask folks at the camp!\n\nI tell you, these gnolls have stolen my pumpkins! Of course, they have no idea how to cook besides crudely charring anything with camp fire from time to time.\n\nThey have no idea what you could make out of our sweet pumpkins! Barbarians!'
