-- Fix typo in quest description of Finding Akh Z'ador.
UPDATE `quest_template` SET `Details`='My strength is sapped. I feel aged and weak, but I saw a city. A city that was submerged beneath the waves, as if the tides themselves had come and drowned it all. There were tall cliffs, massive in scale, and it seemed as if the spirits there wallowed in misery. Red leaves fell from the trees and a strong magic lingered and pulsated as if it wanted me gone. It weakened me and made it hard to focus.\n\nI am certain that Akh Z\'ador is on this world right now. He must have faced something on the Outland and been forced to leave. That, or his rift\'s instability sent him to this foreign landscape.\n\nThis is but all I can remember, outsider. It seemed as if whatever resided there was strongâ€”much stronger than the wildlife here. Much stronger than even you. I beg of you to try to find Akh Z\'ador wherever he may be, no matter how long it takes you.' WHERE `entry`=40033;
