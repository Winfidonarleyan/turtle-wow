-- The loss of the Sunwell has affected us all, some more profoundly than others. Our daily use of the arcane has been curtailed. Unfortunately, some individuals have miscalculated the severity of the situation and have now fallen prey to their hunger, transforming into the withered.$B$BAs a promising mage apprentice, times may prove to be quite challenging for you. With the arcane being your primary source of power, you must possess the control and discipline to comprehend your limitations. Seek me out on the lower level of the main building, where our journey together can commence.

-- Light be with you, aspirant. I am Lor\'thas, a Paladin, like yourself. I write this letter to inform you of my presence in the academy and to offer you advice and training. You are surely aware of our new condition that, sadly, cannot be prevented. However, we may prolong its inevitable onset.$B$BThe Light offers us discipline and salvation, though what we truly seek is redemption and justice. Under its brightness, the Light shall provide us a chance to repay the Scourge a debt long overdue. You shall find me on the lower level of the main building.

-- Thief, scoundrel, and outlaw: these names defined you before the fall of your homeland.$B$BIt seems that fate smiles upon you, for no one shall concern themselves with your past if you are willing to contribute to the greater cause. But I, who remember you, am interested in your change of heart.$B$BFear not, for my anger has subsided, and I am interested in your ability to endure the darkest aspects of Silvermoon. Join me, and together let us embrace these shadows, for you will never be wealthy, but your hunger will never again consume you.$B$BYou will find me to the left of the Golden Ranger.‚Äù

-- Anger can become your most powerful weapon as long as you do not let it eat away at you. Despite our losses, do you not perceive that many of the others have simply accepted their despair instead of channeling their willpower to reclaim and avenge?$B$BMy blade swirls with grace and poise, akin to how the leaves dance amid autumn. So too shall yours, if you join me for a lesson or two in mastering it. Perceive your anger as a tool. Tame it so that those who perish at your hands will be awed by your craft. I will be waiting for you in the smaller building to the left of the Golden Ranger.

-- Item Blessed Elegant Letter should be readable with text:
-- Blessings of the Sun.$B$BI am pleased to learn that another devotee of faith has joined our cause. Many of our people were not previously eager to embrace the Light, even before the Scourge's attack. Some believers even abandoned their faith after the loss of our homeland.$B$BNonetheless, the Light's smallest glimmer shines even in the darkest cave. Thus, you and I are tasked with guiding our people back to their faith and helping them through these times of adversity. Though the Sunwell is gone, the Sun continues to shine brightly. Don't forget we are here to aid, heal, and support our people, which is precisely what they need now. If you seek my guidance or instruction, you shall locate me on the lower level of the main building.

-- I greet you, fellow ranger-in-training. I appreciate the way you carry yourself and the determination you demonstrate in following the footsteps of our renowned brethren.$B$BBefore the fall of Quel'Thalas, I was a freshly inducted member of the Farstriders, a contingent of skilled rangers who ventured beyond our borders to guard our lands and honor. The legacy of the Farstriders has been diminished during these trying times. However, I believe we can restore it, albeit gradually, together. Meet with me; I will be somewhere in the outskirts of Brinthilien.

I require him eliminated. Assemble a formidable party, dispatch him, and dispose of his body in a lake.$B$BOnce the grim task is accomplished, present his signet as proof to Melathe Shadesong.
