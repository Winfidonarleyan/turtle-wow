I know that we must somehow uncover the secrets of Ur without his book, but how - how in the blazes can we even go about doing that?$B$BLast I heard, the Forsaken of the Horde claimed the book from the Silverlaine Keep - I fear it may be lost to us forevermore. However, I still have hopes. There was a girl in Shademore Inn who claimed to have escaped Gilneas City by leaping over its walls. My doubts aside, she actually sold me some useful information. It might well be that the library in Gilneas City holds a copy of the Book of Ur.$B$BI would greatly appreciate it if you could retrieve it for me.' where entry = 41112;
-- Quest 40967 - Ravenwood Keep - remove comma in the sentence "It seemed that the Harlows, had delved into dark magicks to bolster their armies.", it shouldn't be there

Even my loyal servants were not spared from the carnage. Among the casualties were two of my dearest friends, Gately and Mathias.$B$BNow, as the dust settles, a haunting presence looms within the very walls that once provided solace and protection. The restless spirits of Gately and Mathias wander aimlessly, their once noble hearts consumed by bitterness. No longer able to distinguish friend from foe, they wreak havoc upon any who dare to cross their path.$B$BLay these tormented souls to rest, so that they may find peace in the embrace of the eternal slumber.' where entry = 40967;

Whether it\'s you or some other that brings me a bag of heads, it makes no difference.$B$BOh, don\'t look at me like that, you know I\'m right. Anyway, if you want something meaningful to do, listen: our scouts overheard that two ogres are vying for power amongst the Brol\'ok. One of which calls himself Shinban Four-Eyes. A two headed ogre with three actual eyes, claims the fourth is a hidden one that gives him the vision required to lead!$B$BI would be worried about that, $N. Either he is telling the truth and is a caster powerful enough to have magical sight, or he is smart enough to understand metaphors. Both are worrying.
