You see, young $R, demonic corruption is not the biggest problem here.\n\nThe land cries out for help. Some kind of evil forces have settled near Lake Mennar. They drain the very essence of the Earth, consuming magic and nature alike. Nagas or satyrs are not that powerful, they could not do that. Blue Dragonfilght, on the other hand...\nPlease, go and see what is happening at Lake Mennar, the future of Azshara may be in your hands.' WHERE `entry` = 40295;
