I survived the war with the Orcs and the Scourge. But never ever have I seen these lands in such a sorry state. And it is not only because of the Defias.\n\nYou see, many years ago, a… salesman arrived in Westfall. He brought new commodity- Harvest Golems. At first, farmers were overjoyed. The new golems worked flawlessly, gathering crops for them, and scaring the wildlife away. So, more and more golems were being purchased. In a few years, they outnumbered the farmers. And then… It happened.\n\nGolems turned on their owners. In a few weeks, almost all farms across Westfall were lost to the mechanical menace. And to make matters worse, the Defias arrived. So it was only natural that the people of Westfall linked the sudden change of attitude to the Brotherhood.But I believe that it is a mere coincidence. That someone else manipulated the golems to behave this way, and now, of course the Defias are using the situation to their advantage.\n\nI will continue the story later, $N. For now, let’s get to the matters at hand. I have a request for you. I want to help the people of Westfall, and I think I have the solution. Yet, I need some materials. Go to Moonbrook. Before it got overrun, the smith always had a stash of useful engineering equipment hidden in his forge. Check it out.' WHERE entry = 40485;
