After killing over 3,769 worgs in Tirisfal Glades, with stringy wolf meat x2000,
discolored worg hearts x2946, and many useless greens... I got my DARKWOOD POLE.
Now to say that its better than the quest pole for horde would be a lie, however..
Its pretty neat to see. Good luck to those still grinding it out!
