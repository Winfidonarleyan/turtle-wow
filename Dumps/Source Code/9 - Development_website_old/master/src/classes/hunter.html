                  Hunter’s main problem in vanilla comes down to two issues: DPS does not scale well with their gear so
                  they tend to not be competitive in endgame stages, and their pets are particularly fragile in a raid
                  setting, often leading to them not being used. </p>

                  Burning Crusade fixed hunter’s problems at the same time with pet scaling, Kill Command, and Steady
                  Shot abilities - leading them becoming massively overpowered. Avoiding this while also addressing
                  their vanilla issues can be done by not giving them all three at once.
