                        Sick of snagging two-handed axes that are as useful as a screen door on a submarine? Fed up with trying to calculate how much intellect or spell damage you need to avoid becoming the laughing stock of your dungeon party? Fear not, my friend!

                        Join the Vagrant's Endeavor challenge and bid farewell to the headache of having to pick the right item stats! You'll be forced to wear nothing but poor or common quality gear until you hit level 60. Enchanting items is not permitted.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But fear not, once you reach that milestone, you'll be rewarded with the coveted title of "The Wanderer" and a beat-up mule to lug around all your not-so-valuable possessions. Who needs rare items when you can have a donkey, am I right?
