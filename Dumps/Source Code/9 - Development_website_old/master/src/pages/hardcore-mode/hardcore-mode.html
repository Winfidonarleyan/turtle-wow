                        Inspired by Diablo games and actual Hardcore Challenge of Classic realms, we welcome you to join
                        the
                        true test of your player's skills: leveling as a mortal being. The ultimate goal of this
                        challenge is
                        to reach level 60 without ever dying. Once you’re level 60, you can participate in raiding and
                        PvP
                        without a risk of losing your character. Mode can be removed upon reaching level 60 even if the remove chance is already used.

                    <p class="text-white w-100 mb-5">
                        To join the challenge, create a character as usual and find the NPC named Mysterious Stranger in
                        your
                        starting location. Accept and complete the quest “Stay awhile and listen…” to become mortal.
                        This
                        decision is irreversible. Your bags, bank and mail items will be erased once you turn
                        mortal.<BR><BR>
                        You will automatically join a Hardcore chat channel that's only accessible by Hardcore and Inferno mode players to help you easily find players who are also leveling hardcore characters. This feature allows you to form independant guilds without losing contact with the Hardcore community at large.

                        When your character dies, the game ends for you. If you choose to create and play a hardcore
                        character, you do so at your own risk: we will not restore any deceased hardcore characters for
                        any
                        reason including connection problems, bugs, global warming, your little sister, or any other
