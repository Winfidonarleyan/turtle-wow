                        Long has it been since explorers reveled stories of the great Isle of Giljim, and the Island of

                        world. A place where trolls practiced shadow, a place where pirates called home and brewed ale
                        to the
                        cartload! Surely these tales and stories are just that, stories right? Is what the old travelers
                        say
                        true, are there really islands out there, that beckon new adventurers?

                        Under order of the Blackrock senate, an excavation by the Dark Iron dwarves has been issued in

                        mine day in day out, yet with no apparent results. Suspicious of their actions, members of the
                        Royal Senate of Ironforge and the renegade group of Blackrock Orcs in Karfang Hold seek the aid
                        of adventurers to unveil the shadows seeping out of the Hateforge Quarry.

                        started retreating and hiding more and more in the secretive Scarlet Enclave yonder Tyr’s Hand.
                        What they’re conspiring behind that shut gate may remain a mystery for now.
