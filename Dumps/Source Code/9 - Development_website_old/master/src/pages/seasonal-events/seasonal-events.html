                    <p class="text-white">
                        The Mirage Raceway was a race track, deep within the dry lake bed known as the Shimmering Flats.
                        After
                        the end of the Third War, both the goblins and gnomes decided that the large alkali desert known
                        as
                        the Shimmering Flats near Thousand Needles would be a perfect place to test their new rocket
                        designs.
                        The natural animosity between the two engineering teams created the perfect opportunity for
                        races to
                        see once and for all whether Goblin Engineering or Gnome Engineering was superior.<bR><Br>
                        However, Mirage Raceway was never fully implemented as a gameplay event. On the official
                        Blizzard
                        servers you can see gnome and goblin cars racing, but they’re driven by NPCs.
