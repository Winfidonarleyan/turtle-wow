                        Join the Vagrant's Endeavor challenge and bid farewell to the headache of having to pick the right item stats! You'll be forced to wear nothing but poor or common quality gear until you hit level 60. Enchanting items is not permitted.

                        <br>
                        But fear not, once you reach that milestone, you'll be rewarded with the coveted title of "The Wanderer" and a beat-up mule to lug around all your not-so-valuable possessions. Who needs rare items when you can have a donkey, am I right?

                        Inspired by Diablo games and actual Hardcore Challenge of Classic realms, we welcome you to join
                        the
                        true test of your player's skills: leveling as a mortal being. The ultimate goal of this
                        challenge is
                        to reach level 60 without ever dying. Once youâ€™re level 60, you can participate in raiding and
                        PvP
                        without a risk of losing your character. Mode can be removed upon reaching level 60 even if the remove chance is already used.

                        You are a walking arsenal? Do you switch weapons on the fly, but are held back by lacking expertise? Choosing the Exhaustion glyph might remedy this problem for you! With this glyph in your possession, your rate at which your weapon skill increases doubles at the cost of no longer receiving rested experience. If you are everso restless and journey far and wide, seek the Glyph Master in your starting zone to enable this challenge.
