                          Your creative efforts haven't gone unnoticed by the goblins of Gadgetzan, and they have gone through the effort of building a proper art museum in Steamwheedle Port! Being rich in gold brings taste in art they say, most of the time anyway.
                            <br>
                          You can now find a dedicated art museum of your favorite Art Contest winners in Tanaris, located in Steamwheedle Port to the east of Gadgetzan.
