               <p class="w-50 mt-3 text-white">
                  Sound design has always been a big part of Warcraft Universe. It helped bring players closer to the
                  stories this world had to offer and enhanced the experience its players had. For that reason, we aim
                  to keep up with this tradition and provide our players with excellent sound design to match the new
                  content we provide.

                        Exploring Azeroth has been a huge and meaningful experience to me since the days of Warcraft
                        III, and
                        music has played a special part in it. It's a key element of creating that immersive sensation
                        of
                        wonder and adventure. I'm honored to be able to share my passion, skills and experience with the
                        Turtle WoW community, and I hope my musical work can help evoke the immersion which I enjoy
                        myself so
                        much.

                  As we introduce many new characters, we strive to give them more life to make them feel like a part of
                  the world they inhabit. And what better way to do that than to provide them with their own voices.

                        The community that Turtle WoW fosters is one of teamwork, passion, and care that is almost
                        unprecedented in other games past and present. I'm thankful to be working with such incredible
                        people and extremely humbled by their willingness to let me express myself in my voicework. For
                        Azeroth!
