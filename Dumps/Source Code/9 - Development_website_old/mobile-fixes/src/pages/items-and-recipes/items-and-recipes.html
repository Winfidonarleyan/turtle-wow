                  Оne of our goals is to alter or enhance certain existing aspects of the game to uphold current
                  standards, this also extends to items as well. Unique item design is one of the strongest parts of
                  Vanilla, finding that item with the prefix "of the Bear" amongst the piles of rubbish has always felt
                  good, feeling truly rewarded after getting that one item you grinded a dungeon for days. Even if we
                  want to preserve this feeling there are items that are too weak for their qualities, that end up
                  sharded whenever they drop.

                  Many crafted items, world drop epics and even some high level dungeon drops have been adjusted to
                  bring their power level to similar items to make them more worthwhile to use.

                  Over 1000 new items have been added all around Azeroth, from simple quest drops to powerful armaments
                  from dungeons and even some you can make yourself! Some items were contributed from the community via
                  the forum.
