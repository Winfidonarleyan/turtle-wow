                        Turtle WoW is home to a lively roleplaying scene and roleplay has been an integral part of the
                        server since its early beginnings. For several years, roleplaying turtles have been creating
                        amazing storylines and character arcs. Today, Turtle WoW is home to numerous roleplaying guilds
                        that host several events every week.
