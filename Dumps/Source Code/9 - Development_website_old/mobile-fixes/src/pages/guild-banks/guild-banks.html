                  Are you tired of stashing away your guild's goodies on your alts? By paying a hefty sum of gold, you
                  can unlock the Guild Vault to store all your valuables. And if that is not enough, you can always pay
                  extra gold from either the guild vault or your own pockets for additional tabs. Personalize your vault
                  by adding icons to the tabs, limiting the number of items you take daily and which guilds ranks can
                  access them.

                  Guild Vaults have been added, they can be unlocked by paying a hefty sum of gold, with extra tabs
                  costing extra gold, either from the vault itself donated by members or from your pockets.
