Restarting of the game (client) may/will help.\r\n\r\nIt is not related to Darkshore, its can happen in any zone, but only noticeably visible near cliffs (they get sharper, landscape geometry gets lower resolution, and characters get underground partially, when climbing cliffs, because lower part of hill got displaced to wider area), so if you are not climbing hills often, then possibly you will not experience it often. That issue is purely cosmetic, so it's not necessary to restart the game right away, when it happens.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what to do with it, i believe, changing video settings may help (especially things, like refresh rate cap, renderer type, maybe trying out VanillaFixes loader. It is specific to Vanilla 1.12 engine bugs, i think (Turtle Wow is based on vanilla 1.12 client, so it has that too). I also checked my RAM and GPU Memory for errors, and looks, like these errors are only in WoW 1.12 (i have not experienced visual bugs anywhere else).\r\n\r\nOther things to note: on GTX 1060 i used 1080p or 1200p (16:10) resolution, and these days, with RTX 3070 i use 4K (2160p) resolution, so, possibly, resolution is also important thing for the issue reproduction. Very few amount of playes play in 4K, even steam users are like 1-2% of total playerbase, so its unlikely, that this issue will ever get known by masses of Vanilla 1.12 client users.\r\n\r\nUPD:\r\nforgot to mention, Vanilla 1.12 clients is so strange, when i set high refresh rate (120, 144, or 240) IIRC i tried it with the VanillaFixes, i hear my videocard coolers working louder, but the Process Explorer (known task manager tool) displays, that GPU load is nearly zero, i dont understand why it is so, but my uncapped FPS ranges in the 220-360 range, so even tools displaying GPU load fail at measuring it.\r\n\r\nEventually i use VanillaFixes DXVK version (it reduces chance for memory leaks/errors), also i enbled hardware mouse, because without it i can not make mouse responsive (without noticeable, annoying delays), rawMouse also did not help, at least in combination with VanillaFixes (it just works as by default, with delays). I do get stutters, but im not sure its possible get rid of them at all (on 1.12 based client), and maybe pfQuest is the cause, and not the hardware mouse setting. My uncapped FPS ranges around 200-300 (120-500 (usually 200-300), but i use cap at 60 FPS (by enabling V.

Describe how it should work:**\r\nThis is nearly identical to how the summoned Infernal script is supposed to work, but with one change. When a Doomguard is summoned by means of the Curse of Doom spell, it will pick up a hate list of enemy targets within its normal detection range and remain spawned as long as his hate list has something on it. The Doomguard can be kited, the same as the infernal, which can increase targets on the hate list. Once the Doomguard's hate list is empty, it despawns within 10 seconds of it remaining clear.\r\n\r\nThe Ritual of Doom means of summoning it is slightly different. The Doomguard gains the casting Warlock as its initial hate list target automatically the moment it spawns. The amount of hate the Doomguard has for the Warlock is extremely weak - a lvl 1 healing spell or a buff cast on the Warlock from another player will put the 2nd player higher on the hate list every time. It follows the exact same behavior for despawning when its hate list is clear within 10 seconds.","updatedAt":"2022-05-28T17:54:12+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-05-28T17:54:07+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Firestoat"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"jameyboor"},"body":"Fixed in next update.","createdAt":"2022-05-28T17:53:58+0200"}],"createdAt":"2022-05-23T20:37:02+0200","number":1434,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Warlock Spell Inferno (Mob: Infernal duration)","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\nCurrently on the server, if an Infernal is summoned by the Warlock spell, Inferno, it will remain spawned for a duration of 30 minutes.

Describe how it should work:**\r\nHow it should work - The Inferno Spell will summon the Infernal Mob which will gain a hate list of enemy flagged mobs and players within its normal radius for detection. The mob will remain spawned for as long as the hate list contains targets. Note that healing or buffing a player or mob adds targets to the hate list as usual.\r\n\r\nOnce the hate list is empty, the mob will despawn on its own within a 10 second time frame and the hate list continues to be empty. Note that this hate list mechanic for keeping the mob spawned is identical to the mechanic used for the old 2004-2006 retail Doomguard summon, either from Ritual of Doom or Curse of Doom.\r\n\r\n\" When Enslave breaks, the only person that's on the Infernal's agro list is you. If it kills you, then its agro list is empty and it despawns. But what normally happens is that someone else hits the Infernal, or heals you, or does something else to end up on its list - which means that the Infernal won't despawn until that person is dead. \"\r\n\r\nhttp://wowmb.net/forums/f9/2827-infernal_doomguard_discussion/p2/\r\n","updatedAt":"2022-05-28T17:53:58+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-05-28T17:53:58+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"gigachadbro"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"Kruxis"},"body":"Thanks for the report, will be fixed on next server restart =)","createdAt":"2022-05-28T19:10:04+0200"}],"createdAt":"2022-05-23T00:19:31+0200","number":1433,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"mana potions warrior ","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\nHey , i dont think its bug , but it could have better message ! \r\nWhen i try drink mana potions as warrior ( i think all mana potions would say same message ) it says \" you are at full rage \" , and this is already wrong and message could be like this better  : \"Your class cant generate mana\" , or \" your class ressource is rage \" \r\n\r\n**i dont want silly comments like \" are you stupid to not know this ? \" , im suggesting an improvement and fix for the message shown just , i know everything personally about this game , but it would help so much the new players :)** \r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD TO THE QUESTLINE OF INVESTIGATING HAWK'S VIGIL. DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU MIND SPOILERS !!!**\r\n\r\nNot a bug report this time but a suggestion. I will try to make my case (or our case really).\r\n\r\nTo be brief, my team and I noticed something when we tried to run the \"Hawk's Vigil\" quest. Its not a bug at all! The quest works. However ...\r\n\r\nWe realize that \"roleplay is encouraged but not enforced\" on the server as per the rules outlined on the forum. We are not complete strangers to the concept of roleplay so we try to view things both from an **in-character** perspective but also an **out-of-character** perspective when we play on the server.\r\n\r\n(Context for those who do not know: In-character (IC) means \"Everything your character knows\" where as Out-of-character (OOC) means \"Everything you as player knows. Naturally OOC knowledge encompasses IC knowledge (since you as player know everything you do but also everything your character knows) but IC knowledge does not encompass OOC knowledge. Your character doesn't generally know what you as player know. (except if you play a human woman and make fourth wall jokes as it were...)\r\n\r\nAnyways, with that out of the way ... the OOC knowledge of the quest leading to \"Hawk's Vigil\" (the fight against Harlus Ashbuckle) is abundantly clear. The quest clearly ties in with the \"corrupt nobles\" storyline that the alliance player has the pleasure of playing through.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it comes to the IC (in-character) knowledge of the character being sent to **execute** Harlus Ashbuckle (aka. Martin Corinth) the IC (In-character) knowledge of the player is little more than hear-say and suspicions as the player actually lacks any direct evidence of dark arts being practiced.\r\n\r\n**Why is this an important roleplay problem?**\r\n\r\nIC (in-character) the npc Harlus Ashbuckle (Martin Corinth) had already been sentenced to execution but **was pardoned** and the sentence overturned into an exile **on the stipulation that the npc stops practicing dark arts**. However from an OOC perspective, the questline is abundantly clear about the npc being the \"villain of the story\" and very much the \"practitioner of dark arts\" he was sentenced for.\r\n\r\n**So where is the problem then?**\r\n\r\n_The problem is that the IC character does not have the OOC knowledge or direct evidence for that npc practicing dark arts - while they stand before the npc telling them they are to be executed for something that there does not seem to be direct IC (in-character) evidence for._\r\n\r\n\r\n**So then, what do you propose to change and resolve that problem?**\r\n\r\nMy team and I were thinking ... probably the path of least resistance since everything works great otherwise! We would propose the following change to two quest-texts:\r\n\r\nThis is what the player has as conversation option to click when they right click the npc after accepting the Hawk's Vigil\" quest to fight against Harlus Ashbuckle.\r\n\"Martin Corinth, you are to be executed for crimes against the alliance\"\r\n-> changed to ->\r\n\"Martin Corinth, you are under suspicion of violating the stipulation of your pardon and suspected of practicing dark arts within alliance territory.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the other change we would propose is the scripted response of the npc after the player selects the above conversation option:\r\n\"Executed?!\"\r\n-> changed to ->\r\n\"Oh, so you found me out. I thought that might happen eventually but if you are as smart as to come this far you must know that I cannot afford to leave any witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nAnother thing we had to look up on the database (which is an out-of-character action) is that the npc seems to have shadow resistance. We wanted to propose to remove that resistance and, instead, giving him the warlock armor spell to periodically cast as an IC (in-character) action (every half hour or whenever that spell needs to be renewed). That would add a layer of  detective work for players to get an indication of dark arts being practiced. granted they would need the \"detect magic spell\" or to observe the npc when the spell is cast but we feel that would make an excellent addition so we wanted to propose it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe realize that these are only very minor changes and actual game-performance is not affected but we feel it would serve the questline and **enhance the roleplay around it** that tries to portray a villain and practitioner of dark arts to make it more obvious at the very end and unveil the villain for the \"practitioner of dark arts\" he is meant to be.\r\n\r\nFinally we would like to say that we feel that this questline was very lovingly crafted and convey and show our respect for all the work that went into that quest and conceptualizing, writing and building it as it is. It takes a lot of effort and knowledge to create, conceptualize and then tie-in a quest of such depth within and into an already existing framework.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and for reading our case. \r\n\r\nNaturally, if everything, even the texts discussed here, is as intended, please do not mind our suggestion, we mean to help ... not infringe upon creative works.\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=52119\r\nQuest: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=55225","updatedAt":"2022-05-04T03:05:22+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-05-04T03:05:22+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Fin9622"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"Please report it to Moon, it's a client-side thing.","createdAt":"2022-05-01T09:31:38+0200"}],"createdAt":"2022-05-01T08:25:53+0200","number":1365,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Disgusting Oozeling does not go in the spellbook","body":"Disgusting Oozeling https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=20769 does not go in the spellbook\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83077166/166134917-767bc76f-4d86-4343-ad51-1c4031080687.png)\r\n","updatedAt":"2022-05-01T09:31:38+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-05-01T09:31:38+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Fin9622"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-05-01T07:58:41+0200","number":1364,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Blade of Infinite Mysteries can't be repaired","body":"Blade of Infinite Mysteries  https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=61006 can't be repaired","updatedAt":"2022-05-01T09:37:46+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-05-01T09:37:46+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"tubtubs"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"This is working as intended :) The maximum standing you can get by killing mobs is 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66763404/166118180-a8ff1a68-b52b-4610-8c39-93a4fa606c56.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66763404/166118172-76732460-0317-4e18-a602-0070678c4610.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66763404/166118188-9de8c49d-dadd-4692-a431-fb84144f9ef8.png)\r\n\r\n5 points are given only if your level isn't far above the creature level:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66763404/166118234-96ee6468-cb0a-4a60-8f90-a0bd4535e796.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2022-04-30T20:34:18+0200"},{"author":{"login":"tubtubs"},"body":"![WoW 2022-04-30 11-36-18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96892771/166118415-5f26b480-e0c8-4e6b-b859-6e1d4b292ff1.png)\r\n![WoW 2022-04-30 11-35-53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96892771/166118416-b35a01e5-5e78-4d63-ba3a-82c4dc9f994a.png)\r\nIt really is supposed to say +5 but give no rep?","createdAt":"2022-04-30T20:40:01+0200"}],"createdAt":"2022-04-30T20:01:42+0200","number":1363,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Wastewander Bandit/Thief don't actually reward Steamwheedle Reputation on death","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\nThere's a chat message, and scrolling combat text rewarding Steamwheedle Cartel Reputation, but tracking the value for the reputations (watching them carefully mouse over while killing) reveals that no reputation is gained.\r\n\r\nThere may be more mobs impacted by this bug, but I have noticed it in Tanaris on these specific mobs so far. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

In AQ20 there are even higher resistances, bosses and mobs range from 115-155 (ossirian excluded). The resistance in classic seems to be roughly 30, see below.\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\nTo check the average damage mitigation casters get in classic I looked at elemental shamans, since no curse helps them with nature resistance. I exluded anyone with spellpen gear and only looked at boss encounters so the level-based resistance would be at a flat 24 resistance and 6% average damage mitigation from it. Thunderfury debuff was too prevalent to be excluded, but the shamans without this debuff showed no exception. That is a bit odd since the resistances doesnt seem to be 0, but it could just be a small sample.\r\n\r\nLinks to the 9 ele shamans I checked:\r\nhttps://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/reports/6b2AQDKWJxVqFv3r#type=damage-done&boss=-2&difficulty=0&source=32\r\nhttps://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Tnq1jP42XVfGgFdZ#type=damage-done&boss=-2&difficulty=0&source=34\r\nhttps://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Y7zcgkPXfwyMGhCD#type=damage-done&boss=-2&difficulty=0&source=29\r\nhttps://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/reports/6XdRpDPCzyHtWfkb#type=damage-done&boss=-2&difficulty=0&source=4\r\nhttps://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/reports/rWKHzxGMAZQ7w9Jc#type=damage-done&boss=-2&difficulty=0&source=48\r\nhttps://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/reports/t4xhrNLf3mcGbVjC#type=damage-done&boss=-2&difficulty=0&source=13\r\nhttps://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/reports/L6TwxgKYZCf1jDyn#type=damage-done&boss=-2&difficulty=0&source=16\r\nhttps://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/reports/8nT91ZVHx4DtrkYC#type=damage-done&boss=-2&difficulty=0&source=25\r\nhttps://vanilla.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Wq8thLV4jMB6wrJn#type=damage-done&boss=-2&difficulty=0&source=57\r\n\r\nI calculated the damage mitigation % of their lightning bolt to be 11,12%. Thunderfury debuff uptime was 41,2%, resulting in an average spellpen of 10,2 from the debuff (2,55% decrease of the damage mitigation). This results in an average nature resistance of roughly 30.

I found this out when I was leveling in the Wetlands: the Mosshide Fenrunners and Mosshide Gnolls can apply a disease called Spirit Decay, which decreases your Spirit attribute by 6. Spirit Tap temporarily doubles your Spirit after killing an enemy, however because of the way it is coded it appears to temporarily double any Spirit debuffs you have as well (aka it doubles your TOTAL Spirit, including any Spirit debuffs). In this case, if you are afflicted by Spirit Decay it will double the Spirit loss from -6 to -12. The problem comes when trying to cast Cure Disease on yourself when Spirit Tap and Spirit Decay are both active: Cure Disease will remove the -6 Spirit debuff from the Spirit Decay, however the rest of -6 Spirit will remain even after the debuff has been removed, going down to a PERMANENT -3 Spirit after Spirit Tap expires. This can lead to some unfortunate permanent Spirit loss (I'm currently at -6 Spirit because I've done it twice) that cannot be recovered by any means as far as I'm aware. A similar behavior can be expected if the Spirit Decay debuff naturally expires before Spirit Tap does while both are active.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Play Priest and have 5/5 points in Spirit Tap.  Make sure that you have the Cure Disease spell trained as well.\r\n2. Fight a Mosshide Fenrunner or Mosshide Gnoll and let him cast Spirit Decay on you.\r\n3. When you kill him and Spirit Tap procs, check your attributes. You should have -12 Spirit instead of -6.\r\n4. Cast Cure Disease on yourself while Spirit Tap is still active. The Spirit Decay disease will be gone, but you will have -6 Spirit while Spirit Tap is still active.\r\n5. Wait for Spirit Tap to expire. You should now end up with a permanent -3 Spirit debuff. It can even stack if you do it multiple times.\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=1010\r\n         https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=1007\r\n\r\nSpell: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=15338\r\n         https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=528\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

They also use the abilities at the exact same time, theres no RNG on when they use it. This manifests into buggy, and extremely frustrating encounters all throughout the game, that where multiple mobs either oneshot a dungeon or raid party member or hardcore, or needlessly punish certain classes that cant dispell a mechanic they spam. Here are the most notable, worst offenders:\r\n\r\nEvery spider, from teldrasil to silithus spiders, will net you almost permanently. \r\nSimilarly blackrock orcs outside UBRS and BWL, and EPL bats, will try to keep slowing poision up almost permanently\r\nStockades trash mobs, and BFD crabs at the start will keep the tank disarmed for about 50% of the time\r\nNaxx big spiders will cast their poision at the same time, Naxx cursed staves and axes will do their AOE same time, same with faerlina humanoid trash, Gothik trainees and deathknights will do their stun and threat drop at the same time\r\nBWL Taskmasters often like to cast their 1.5k shadowbolt, immediately at the same time. this is 5.5k damage and oneshots anyone thats not a tank, and nearly kills tanks too\r\nMC garr's adds all put the debuff at the same time which absolutely annihilates tanks not in t3, \r\nUBRS orcs that charge will all charge and stunlock whoever pulls for 3 seconds, so the ideal strat is for a DPS to pull so the tank can actually tank. The summoners at the start and mid of UBRS will also instantly start their summon, and when these are paired with the stunning/knockback mobs, the tank only has a tiny bit of time before they can interrupt the summoner, making these packs far harder than intended.  \r\nStrat guards that spawn after Ramstein the Gordger, all cast their shadowbolts at the same time. Last i remember this does like 5k damage at once? Anyone who doesnt sheild wall this is dead meat, and also dead meat if the dps cant get them down before wall ends. This is very clearly not blizzlike.\r\nBRD baelgar trash mobs will spam their cleaves and others their abilities making this part the hardest dungeon section in the game, even harder than black morass.\r\n\r\nThese problems are extensive and shouldnt be fixed 1 by 1, there are countless other issues that aren't blizzlike and I forgot about. the entire game, in this regard, needs a blanket rework \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

This spawn seems duplicated, or something. At least 1 supressor is down but it took us about 30 seconds to do so. In the wow classic source I think this group takes a similiar amount of time to kill the supressor, but we may have been extra behind since our DPS was a little AFK and not as spell cleave heavy perhaps.\r\n\r\nI don't know exactly what this fight is supposed to look like but there are a few things that stick out here. The \"wow classic\" version of this fight I linked seems much much slower paced. Even if DPS were increased greatly, in the footage from wow classic it seems to take at least an extra 2 minutes (or 4ish minutes from encounter start) for 4 bloodkeepers to spawn, where as 4 bloodkeeper spawns happens within just over 2 minutes from starting the encounter on Turtle WoW. \r\n\r\nIn fact, it seems like there are 6 blood keepers spawned in about 4 minutes on Turtle WoW. I don't know if this fight is supposed to be timer based or spawn sequentially (blood keeper -> suppressor -> blood keeper -> ...). In any event, there's way more spawns.\r\n\r\nI've recorded some time stamps while analyzing the footage to help review my observations.\r\n\r\nTurtle WoW time stamps:\r\n~45s start\r\n54s first one spawns\r\n1 31 first one goes down,\r\n1 50 supressor spawns\r\n@255 3 bloodkeepers are up, one has died.

Should your group wipe, fail, or reset the encounter for whatever reason the second summon will be bugged. There will be no spawns for the 2nd use of the spawn item but the doors will still come down locking you in. A 3rd summon is possible, but buggy\r\n\r\n2. Occasionally the encounter seems to bug, and just reset. I believe I've had resets when suppressors were properly handled, and couldn't explain why. I'm not positive, but it seems to be more likely to happen on the third spawn but may also be related to how fast the fires are doused during the first phase of the encounter. It seems like more enemies spawns in general than before on this server, but especially the Hakkari Bloodkeepers that drop the bloods which I suspect could be causing issues.\r\n\r\nI don't have a lot of good notes on how this encounter works, since it can be a rather hectic fleeting experience but it does need some investigation. My characters have completed this quest, but if I attempt this encounter again I'll try to record the experience better.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behaviour:**\r\n\r\nFrom wowhead comments it sounds like this boss should only be summonable once per instance reset. It might be preferable to being locked in during a 2nd summon with no mobs though the accuracy is questionable.\r\n\r\nThere should be a delay between Hakkari Bloodkeeper spawns like time or the death of a Nightmare Suppressor. Though, I've seen several bloodkeepers spawn in a very short time sometimes overlapping, but it could be that extra glitchy 3rd summon. I've been wondering if dousing two flames before killing a suppressor is some kind of sequence break that causes the script to reset but haven't had the patience/group to test that.\r\n\r\nThe wow classic footage shows less adds than I recall during the encounter, but I'll be sure to check back with confirmation of that if I attempt this encounter again.

Describe how it should work:**\r\nApproximately 1 in 20 traps should immobilize a mob.\r\n\r\nI also tested this with Frost Trap.  In Vanilla, Frost Trap had a chance to immobilize once per server tick for every mob in the trap, which means there should be a very high chance of a proc.  You can kite a mob around in the Frost Trap effect on TWoW and it *will* be immobilized occasionally.  So something's working.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Immo trap is not properly applying the chance when it is first triggered?\r\n\r\nOr I have extraordinarly bad luck.  If it ever procs I'll amend this report!\r\n\r\nI use immo trap for every kill, so I will report back with more results later.","updatedAt":"2022-06-03T15:46:38+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-06-03T15:46:38+0200"},{"assignees":[{"login":"jameyboor"}],"author":{"login":"virre117"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"geojak"},"body":"Another bug with this quest line.\r\nLater one you get an egg and in need 3 days to hatch on classic.
