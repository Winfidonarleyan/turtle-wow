This happened while I was not stunned, nor facing away from the boss, and I kept attacking the boss during this time while the healer did everything in their power to keep me alive (which was doomed to fail).\r\n\r\nI am not certain of the exact course of the fight, as my combat log wasn't scrollable far enough, but it _might_ have something to do with the fact that I used an engineering Masterwork Training Dummy to avoid the stun/fear effect the boss does, by activating it mere moments before the cast went through.\r\n\r\nIf this has something to do with the somewhat recent change to rogue avoidance being nullified while soloing bosses (or doing them in small groups), in our case we had a full group of 5 people. Besides, shouldn't that change be retired already, since after Flourish was given a cooldown it should no longer be possible to maintain full unhittability for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the elemental mobs of the dungeon and the boss Mossheart are all immune to Agitating Poison, making tanking them much more difficult for rogues. I get the lore-based reasoning of having certain mobs be immune to certain damage types, but in this case they're being made immune to a specific tank (though admittedly very niche). Perhaps Agitating Poison could be made to generate its threat regardless of immunity to the damage component?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

Describe how it should work:**\r\n\r\nDampen magic should have the exact formula and affect spell overall, not every tick:\r\n\r\n> Spells are Modified by **SpellCoeffcient** * (**AmplifyMagicValue** - **DampenMagicValue**)\r\n> If this reduces total spell damage by more than 50%, the effect is capped at 50%.\r\n> Bandage and HealthPotions are not affected by Dampen/Amplify.\r\n\r\nTo prove that formula and statement about not affecting every tick being correct here is an old vanilla famous video:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Mh_cLN66zHA?t=619  (10:19 timing)\r\nMage buffed by dampen magic fights a lock. Due to lock being 58 lvl he is using corruption **rank 6** (**666** damage pet 18seconds). It's clearly visible that mage recieves damage of **108** per tick.\r\n1. According to my formula: 1 * (0-90) = minus 90 clear amplify damage reduction to spell overall.\r\n2. 108x6 = **648** damage per 18 seconds will be recieved by buffed mage from a 58 lvl lock using rank 6 corruption.\r\n3. Without dampen it will be 738 damage total what seems accurate taking in account his low lvl, spell rank used and explains dampen magic behaviour that works alongside provided formula.\r\n\r\nNow how it works on TwoW:\r\n1. https://i.imgur.com/gh0BtdP.mp4 - 298 spd 60 lvl lock uses **rank 7** (**822** damage pet 18seconds) corruption doing **186** damage to mage withiut DM = 186 x 6= **1116** damage overall\r\n2. https://i.imgur.com/XKnVhZp.mp4 - 298 spd 60 lvl lock uses **rank 7** (**822** damage pet 18seconds) corruption doing **96** damage to mage buffed with DM (no talent) = 96 x 6 = **576** damage overall\r\n3. Damage reduction almost doubled vs vanilla spell behavior.\r\n4. Conclusion - geared TWoW 60 lock with rank 7 dot does lower damage than retail 58 lock with rank 6 dot due to bugged dampen magic.\r\n\r\nResult: TWow dampen magic affects every tick and should be fixed according to provided formula.","updatedAt":"2023-12-25T10:48:11+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Soph3X"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"Duplicate of https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/5040","createdAt":"2023-12-19T19:56:22+0100"}],"createdAt":"2023-12-17T18:11:53+0100","number":5630,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Gilneas targetting bug","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.Nagas in Gilneas on the beach are not targettable from range or with pets. \r\n2.

Get 21 mana every 2 seconds while casting (as per BetterCharacterStats description - spirit regen 61mp2 when not casting, 15% of that is 9; got 30mp5 from gear so 12mp2, 9+12=21, that's 21 mana every 2 seconds, all checks out).\r\n4. I equip 2 rings, amulet and cloak which all combined give me 20% mana regen while casting, 5mp5 and 23 spirit.\r\n5. BetterCharacterStats now reports I have 68mp2 spirit regen when not casting, 35% mana regen while casting total, 35 mp5 regen and 14 mp2 regen and should be getting 37 mana every 2 seconds now (68x0.35 + 14 = 37).\r\nYet I only get 24 mana every 2 seconds so only 3 more than before equipping all those items (1mp2 from 23 spirit from Meditation's 15% and 2mp2 from 5mp5). Adding items 1 by 1 didn't help anything, 5% didn't kick in at any step.\r\n\r\nFirst Impression - % regen while casting stat from all those items straight up doesn't work.\r\n\r\nItems I equipped:\r\n\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=2043\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=60798\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=60564\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=83465\r\n\r\nBut I tried reseting talents:\r\n\r\n6. 0/0 points in Meditation, all my gear equipped except for those 4 items.\r\n7. Should have 12mp2 while casting now as per BCS report (from mp5 gear pieces) - checks out.\r\n8. Adding 7spi/5% ring - reported mp2 goes from 12 to 15 - checks out.\r\n9. Adding 16spi/5%ring - reported mp2 goes from 15 to 18 - checks out.\r\n10. Adding 5mp5/5% neck - reported mp2 goes from 18 to 24 - checks out (15% regen from gear now, 0% from Meditation)\r\n11. Adding 5% cloak - reported mp2 goes from 24 to 27 - checks out (20% regen from gear now, 0% from Meditation) - got 3 more mp2 now than I had at the begining with 3/3 Meditation and 4/4 gear.\r\n\r\nConclusion - gear % regen works, something not right with Meditation.\r\n\r\n12. Adding 1/3 Meditation - BCS reports 35% regen! (should 25%) and 37 mp2 when casting (as much as it was reporting with 3/3 Meditation in the begining), but actual regen I have is 31mp2 (from 27mp2 so +4), looks like first 1st point in Meditation works although BCS reports wrong, as if 3/3 Med). \r\n\r\n13. Adding 2/3 Meditation - BCS reports 45% regen! (should 30%) and 44 mp2 when casting - actual regen I have 20mp2 when casting (-11). looks like 2nd Med point is working but breaks gear benefits (losing 15 mp2 from gear but gaining 4mp2 from 2nd Med point = net loss 11).\r\n\r\n14. Removed all +5% gear - only lost 2mp2 (from neck's 5mp5) (18mp2 now). Looks like % regen from gear not working indeed.\r\n\r\n15. Equipped all gear back - went back to 20mp2 (as much as in step 13)\r\n\r\n16. Adding 3/3 Meditation - BCS reports 35% now (as it should) and 37mp2 (as at the very beginning) but only have 24mp2 actually (as in the beginning).\r\n\r\n17. Removing 4 pieces - gets me back to 21mp2 (as in the begining before equipping pieces - at step 3).\r\n\r\nAt first I thought maybe 20% is cap but with 3/3 Meditation, adding a single gear piece doesn't increase mp2 as it should. It looks like Meditation points work as they should on their own, it's just that 2nd point breaks benefits from gear.\r\n","updatedAt":"2023-12-13T19:48:33+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-12-13T19:48:33+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"yianakhs4"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"yianakhs4"},"body":"Pls i want someone to answer me and look about it im not R10 to stay same im R8 and i've been playing all this week.

If any ignite is applyed while ignite is already up, the ignite is refreshed (back to being alive for 4 more seconds) and the damage pool from that crit is added to the existing ignite damage pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2023-12-28T17:54:23+0100"},{"author":{"login":"Ormember"},"body":"Is there any information on this issue?","createdAt":"2024-02-04T21:53:56+0100"},{"author":{"login":"BahamutxD"},"body":"After testing this for some time in raid and solo/group content I can tell ignite is not working as it should right now. \r\n\r\nThe major drawback is that the amount of times it resets tick damage because of the bugged refresh window makes the damage from Ignite significally lower than it should. Note that while the debuff may still be up on the target, the damage will reset at times. \r\n\r\nFor solo content there's some notable side effects aswell. While being solo you should be able to stack your own ignite during that 4 second window but that is not working right now and you'll only achieve stacks if you manage to crit constantly with Scorch (1.5s cast no travel time) or Blastwave/Fireblast (instant casts-no travel time)\r\n\r\n**This is how ignite should work.**\r\n\r\n-  Any fire spell critical hit from a mage with Ignite talent (5/5 we have 100% chance) should apply an ignite debuff on the target that will damage the target for 40% of the damage made by that spell and this debuff will tick twice after 2 and 4 seconds doing half of that damage evenly split (so 20% damage from the crit per tick). \r\n\r\nIn TWoW Ignite ticks 3 times at 0-2-4 seconds for 20% each (60% total) <- Either wrong tooltip due to undocumented changes on this talent or bugged behavior.  The first tick shouldn't be happening.\r\n\r\n- The ignite debuff will show on the target the moment a crit lands and will dissapear 4 seconds later (right after 2nd tick) if no other crits happen.\r\n\r\nIn TWoW the debuff is gone after the third tick during the first ignite. If it refreshes it will go after 2 ticks. This is the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nSo if a mage crits for 2400 damage, the ignite should tick for 480 twice (40% of 2400 = 960 -> 480 per tick) 2 and 4 seconds after crit.\r\nIn TWoW if a mage crits for 2400 damage, the ignite ticks for 480 three times. Instaly and 2 and 4 seconds after.\r\n\r\n- If the mage or any other mage with Ignite talent (lets assume 5/5 again for 100% chance) - crits on the target with an ignite debuff up, the damage from that crit will add to the original Ignite and the Ignite debuff timer will reset (so it ticks twice again)\r\n\r\n-  An important note here is that refreshes won't change the pace Ignite ticks come - those will keep coming every 2 seconds after the original crit/ignite started. So several crits between crits will add all that extra damage to the tick during the next tick.\r\n\r\nSo if the same mage/other mage crits for 3000 ( 40% of 3000 =1200 -> 600 per tick) on that same target while Ignite debuff is up, the new ignite will add to the original extending the duration to allow 2 new ticks happen and the tick damage added to the original tick damage.\r\n\r\nIf 2 crits happen between ticks, the damage from each crit will add. So if 2 mages crits for 3000 (600 per tick each mage), that extra 1200 per tick will add to the ignite on the next tick.\r\n\r\nIn TWoW this may not happen, the stack window is either bugged or shorter than intended/debuff duration. So despite having Ignite the tick damage may reset to the newly added tick damage as if the ignite debuff dropped from the target for a moment.\r\n\r\nThis process will keep happening until 5 stacks of Ignite are reached. At that point added damage from new Ignites won't add but they will refresh the duration. Whenever Ignite refreshes, the damage from \"old ticks\" will prevail while the Ignite is alive. To say it another way, the original crit and its consequent 2 ticks won't drop from the ignite tick after those tick twice. For aslong the ignite is up, the damage keeps adding up to 5 stacks of ignite.\r\n","createdAt":"2024-02-26T17:18:58+0100"},{"author":{"login":"pepopo978"},"body":"Totally guessing here since I don't know how much you've changed from vmangos and what @jameyboor did for https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/374 but would love to see this fixed:\r\n\r\nPerhaps a call to `Aura::Update` was added before the `bool reapplyIgnite = igniteAura->GetAuraTicks() >= igniteAura->GetAuraMaxTicks();` check in `HandleDummyAuraProc` to make sure damage was happening before ignite refresh?

Describe how it should work:**\r\nCounterspell Issue (Especially in Arcane):\r\nYou play as a mage, and any time a boss attempts to cast a spell (Or anytime really if you just want to see them silenced), it's both interruptible and also able to be silenced with Improved Counterspell. Easy, simple, straight to the point. Makes the dungeon with a mage even easier than expected. I assume that priest's silence also would work? Just a thought.\r\n\r\nExample: Judge Sutherland is able to be silenced, and when counterspelled, it starts a cooldown for all of his similarly schooled spells, reducing him to melee AI. Furthermore, he's completely silenced too with Improved Counterspell. Tested on all the bosses, every single one was able to be silenced after I saw Sutherland could be interrupted and silenced as Arcane.\r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly, this wasn't an issue in Hateforge Quarry OR Crescent Grove either, so perhaps this was just missed in Gilneas.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFreezable and Slowable?:\r\nFrost spells slowed the Packmaster Ragetooth, and I could kill him like an AoE farm. With max spec in Frost, he was freezable and slowable with Frost Nova and Blizzard. This was before your most recent reset however, I haven't done Gilneas again afterwards.

The player may think their game has just broken on them. Some will walk back and realize the node has reappeared, and will then dissapear once again once they re-approach. This can be a major pain point to players' desire to collect, these few nodes that are uncollectable stand out the hundreds and thousands they can collect normally. https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/5179 https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/4782 https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/5706\r\n- A spawned NPC for a quest might have a path that takes them into a new zone. These scripts do not account for the phasing and will prevent quests from being completable at all. https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/5135 https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/5105 . NPC follow and escort quests similarly suffer: https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/5352\r\n- The client sometimes fails to render zepplins that cross these boundaries. https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/4691","updatedAt":"2024-03-04T22:27:59+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"bobhammer23"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"Sounds like you have the lv 40 version of stealth, which is -35% movespeed, so you are at 65% movespeed.\r\nhttps://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1786/stealth\r\n\r\n5/5 Camoflague will multiply your stealth speed by 115%.\r\n\r\nRank 3 stealth 65% * 115% ~= 75%\r\nRank 4 stealth 70% * 115% ~= 80%\r\nhttps://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14065/camouflage#comments:id=74390\r\n\r\n@bobhammer23 I ask that you do your research first and talk with others who play your class, before submitting bug reports.","createdAt":"2023-11-21T15:45:07+0100"}],"createdAt":"2023-11-21T05:51:40+0100","number":5311,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Stealth Bug","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

GM's used to place the item that the Shadow Assassin's drop(Assassin's contract) in your inventory, but due to the spike in server population they no longer provide that service. As such it is impossible to do the Baron Vardus quest chain.

As you know, this did not charge my character \"Tole\" 300g, but instead awarded him 300g. As I normally do with excess funds, I sent the gold off to bank alts and left 193g on my main character, Tole. The following morning, the 193g was missing and Tole was left with 0g. I was not concerned as I figured it was an intended rake-back of the excess gold.\r\n\r\nStepping forward to this week, a further 600g was taken from my account, username 'Tole', in the amount of 100g from character 'Tole' and 500g from character 'Harambewithu'.

I also currently play both an Enh and Ele shaman on Wotlk Classic.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'd like to applaud the the steps already taken to better support the Enh spec, I think they are steps in the right direction.\r\n\r\nAs we've learned from [interviews from Vanilla class designers](https://youtu.be/iH7xKE0W7Pc), Enh was meant to be a primary melee DPS spec, but was released in a largely unfinished state due to the aggressive development schedule for Vanilla. From my perspective, there are four main issues that are unaddressed with the spec in the Vanilla state:\r\n1. Mana regen issues.\r\n2. Threat issues.\r\n3. RNG issues with WF+2H.\r\n4. Lack of stat scaling with spells/shocks.\r\n\r\nThese were all correspondingly addressed in TBC via:\r\n1. Water Shield's passive mana regen + Shamanistic Rage, (on use mana regen CD).\r\n2. Spirit Weapons, (30% threat reduction).\r\n3. DW to smooth out WF+2H RNG.\r\n4.  Mental Quickness, (added SP scaling with AP).\r\n\r\nGranted these changes didn't make Enh A-tier dps by any means, however they did successfully address the core issues which were interfering with the viability of the spec as a serious melee DPS.\r\n\r\nRe: # 1 Mana regen\r\nThis issue remains unaddressed on TWoW. While water shield was added, it did not include the passive mana regen component of the TBC version, and as Enh should not be taking direct hits as melee DPS, there is in affect no impact on mana regen while raiding. There remains a need for Enh to be able to actively regenerate mana during combat, otherwise you've got a spec which largely can't use it core abilities without going OOM and resorting to just auto-attacking. My suggestion here would be to add the passive mana regen component to Water Shield and/or add some other mechanic which enables active mana regen similar to Shamanistic Rage.\r\n\r\nRe: # 2 Threat Issues\r\nEnh as it currently stands on TWoW still suffers from the same threat issues as it did in Vanilla. The ratio of TPS:DPS lacks balance/parity when compared to other DPS specs. This one is an easy fix IMHO, adding a passive threat reduction talent similar to those which are currently available to most other DPS specs.\r\n\r\nRe: # 3 WF+2H RNG issues\r\nPersonally, I enjoyed the class fantasy of Enh wielding a 2H weapon gaining a lot of satisfaction from those big chunky hits, and was sad to see the switch to DW in TBC. I think an alternate solution for the WF+2H RNG issues would be to consider the approach of a glyph from Wotlk: [Glyph of Windfury](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=41542/glyph-of-windfury-weapon) wherein the % chance for a WF proc is increased with each successive non-WF hit. Albeit the glyph as-is was designed for DW, so the +% WF bonus would have to be increased corresponding with the slow speed of 2H, but I think it merits consideration as an alternative to the DW approach.\r\n\r\nRe: # 4 Lack of stat scaling with spells/shocks\r\nThis issue also largely remains unaddressed on TWoW, as the spec currently gears solely for melee DPS stats: AP/Melee Crit, none of which impact the effectiveness of spells/shocks. This leads to clunky attempts at gearing as \"Spellhance\" with a mix and match approach to gearing with both SP and Melee gear that ultimately fails in execution to yield competitive DPS, (compounded by the aforementioned mana regen issues), or else abandoning the use shocks entirely from the rotation resulting in a pretty boring playstyle IMHO: (SS every 12 secs+auto-attacks). My suggestion here would be to tweak one of the existing Enh talents to incorporate some sort of SP scaling from Melee DPS stats.","updatedAt":"2023-11-15T19:54:22+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-11-15T17:12:16+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"MidnightPulses"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"Are they evading when they are stuck unable to follow?

I didn't even realise this was a bug until I was playing on my friends account and used his Goblin Brainwashing Device and saw that his saved specs show the talent points next to each saved spec.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Simply opening my Goblin brainwashing device will always reproduce this error. Another person in my guild also experiences this issue but only on some of their characters. On their main character the bug is not present. \r\n2. I have also contacted a GM who replaced my Goblin Brainwashing Device (it was removed from my bags in real time and replaced) and the issue still persisted.\r\n3.  I have tried logging into the game with a completely default UI, and still there are no talent points listed. Even when creating a new spec and saving it while on a default UI.\r\n4. I have deleted my WDB folder many times as I always like keeping in-game items listed correctly to the current patch, so it's not related to WDB.\r\n\r\nHere is what mine looks like.

Here's the translated text:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"On Wednesday evening, when I went underwater at a desolate place wearing a diving helmet, there was no breath bar displayed, which is normal. However, after a while, I started losing health directly without warning. At that time, I was deep underwater, and it was too late to swim back to the surface! This seems to be a game bug. The diving helmet does not mention any probability of underwater breathing effect, and I double-checked that there was no breath bar when I dived in, confirming that the helmet was correctly worn. This can be seen in the picture.\r\nI'm an engineering major and had not spent a long time underwater before making this helmet.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:\r\n\r\n1. I correctly wore the diving helmet before going underwater.\r\n2. I repeatedly confirmed that there was no breath bar for holding breath.\r\n3. After playing underwater for a while, I started losing health directly. Due to the depth of my dive, it was too late when I realized I was losing health.\r\n4. This character is a slow + HC warrior, my fifth character, with the ID 'Zhan Wu Zha' on the Raven County server.\r\n5. I have invested over a month in developing this character.

Wearing a diving helmet and going underwater without a breath bar, but starting to lose health when the time is up, is a game bug! My turtle + HC warrior, which I played for over a month, dying due to a bug is too unjust!! Even if itΓÇÖs due to server lag, I would accept it! If my helmet was not worn properly, there would be a breath bar when I went underwater, but I confirmed there was no breath bar before diving in. When the time was up, the breath bar suddenly appeared empty, and I started losing health! There was no time to react! Please give me an explanation urgently!

Fire Vulnerability can be resisted from a Target even if ur Scorch was successful (many ppl dont know about this). Same with Winterchill and other Debuffs from Attacks.\r\n\r\nIf u hit a Target with Scorch the first 5 times, the Combatlog will track these Fire Vulnerability debuffs perfect which is important to create working tracking addons. After the 1st Scorch the Combatlog will tell u ''Mob is afflicted by Fire Vulnerability''. After the 2nd Scorch it will tell u ''Mob is afflicted by Fire Vulnerability(2) and so on. But after the 5th cast ''Mob is afflicted by Fire Vulnerability(5)'' it wont show u a Message like ''Mob is afflicted by Fire Vulnerability(5)'' again. It wont track anything if there are already 5 Stacks(Max amount) of Fire Vulnerability on the Target. Thats a 1.12 Client Combatlog Thing.\r\n\r\nAll Addons, All Interfaces are just tracking the ''Scorch-Hits''. So even if ur Fire Vulnerability has been resistet the Timer (BigWigs and so on) will jump back to 30sec after ur Scorch did Damage. But no Mage want to track Scorch. They want to track the Fire Vulnerability debuff attached from the Scorch and they dont want the timer to jump back to 30 when that Fire Vulnerability debuff has been resistet. They have Addons for this in the Classic remake (not a 1.12 Client) which can track resisted Fire Vulnerability debuffs.\r\n\r\nJust imagen. U have 5 Stacks on a Boss and they run out in 5 sec > U cast a Scorch to refresh it > Ur Scorchtimer jumps back to 30 sec bc ur Scorch was hitting the Target but the Fire Vulnerability has been resists so u just loose all ur Stacks of Fire Vulnerability bc there is no way to track resisted Fire Vulnerability debuffs. Atm i just cast Scorch 2 times to refresh the Fire Vulnerability as a workaround.\r\n\r\nAs u all know Turtle wow has more than 16 debuff slots. I see Debuffs on the Mob but i cant see Stacks of the 17th applied debuff (Shagu-Tweaks). If my 5 Stacks run out, there are already to many debuffs on the mob (in Bossfights) from other player so i cant see any of my Fire Vulnerability stacks it event wont show me a single Fire Vulnerability if there are already to many debuffs on the Target. Atm i just cast 5x Scorch blind as workaround.\r\n\r\nAs a Frostmage u just dont have to care about this Problem bc Winterchill will get applied by Frostbolt and u spam Frostbolts all day but as Fire Mage where u have to us a specific cast (Scorch) for that its rly suboptimal.\r\n\r\nCan we fix the Combatlog somehow on that 1.12 client to make it show Stack tracking after (5/Max amount)? Or can we change the Mage Firebolt to make it not attach but at least refresh that fire vulnerability?. Can we make Fire Vulnerability unresistable?. Its not like its unplayable but i understand why many mages rater spamming frostbolts than haveing problems with debuffsstacks running out.\r\n\r\nOn Nostalrius we had the same Problem but if the Fire Vulnerability stacks did run out we where able to see how many Fire Vulnerability Stacks we reapplied bc other ppl where not allowed to use dots. I cant see Stacks if there are more then 16 debuffs and i cant see any debuff it there are more than 32 debuffs on the Target. (Shagun-Tweaks / Debufffilter / BigWigs).\r\n\r\nI was talking to many mages and most of them didnt even realised the Problem with the resistance of Fire Vulnerability. I have no clue how highend raider faceing this problem. I saw that 5 Stacks of Fire Vulnerability running out in Raid which had 3+ Fire Mages bc they think its enough if only 1 mage reapplied that Fire Vulnerability(which can be resisted) Stacks by casting 1 single Scorch. The Talentstree tells u ''Improved Scorch 3/3 = 100% Chance to attach a Fire Vulnerability'' and if they dont know that this debuff can be resisted they trust the blizzard tooltips and loose 15% of fire dmg.\r\n\r\n","updatedAt":"2023-11-15T20:48:24+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-11-15T20:48:23+0100"},{"assignees":[{"login":"slowtorta"}],"author":{"login":"Vynora"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"The staff have decided we will work to support group queue from not only NPCs but also the minimap menu.","createdAt":"2023-11-19T20:42:49+0100"},{"author":{"login":"ratkosrb"},"body":"@twowTurtReynolds Joining Blood Ring queue as a group appears to be prevented client side.

This happens even when tabbed targeting is not used and the pet is set to \"Passive.\" Today, I was fighting on the plains of The Barrens (flat surface, with no \"floors\" above or below me, so not a \"path issue\"), and my bird took off after a fight and disappeared completely (flying far out of sight). I called it back, and it brought the mob it had targeted. There's no way I could have targeted something that was too far away to display on my screen. Not only that, my cursor had not been pointing anywhere near that direction the entire fight.\r\n\r\nSo far, this has happened at least three times in two days with my bird. I don't recall seeing it happen with my boar, though I have wondered at times why my various pets targeted another mob immediately after a fight. I assumed then that it was because it was set to \"Defensive\" mode and I had gotten aggro. But in the most recent cases, I know this could not have been the case.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Fight mobs with pet, and avoid using tabbed targeting.\r\n2. Kill the mob.\r\n3.
