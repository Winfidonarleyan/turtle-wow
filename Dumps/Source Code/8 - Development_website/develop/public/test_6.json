This is about the talent window shown when inspecting other players. The one for your own talents works fine.\r\n\r\nMany custom talents (including modified ones and new ones) are not shown properly, or at all. There are also some vanilla talents that have wrong tooltips.\r\n\r\nI have fixed most, if not all of these issues locally, and you can see the changes here: https://github.com/cyaohiri/TurtleWoW-patches/commit/f6b70d0da5e5a7e93949d7845d307cc0d93e13a1\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that currently, the code makes a new line after each period. See https://github.com/cyaohiri/TurtleWoW-patches/blob/f6b70d0da5e5a7e93949d7845d307cc0d93e13a1/patch-3.mpq/Interface/FrameXML/Turtle_InspectTalentsUI/InspectTalentsFrame.lua#L2500\r\nWhile this works in some cases, in many cases it's wrong and results in line splits where they don't belong, like after a decimal point.\r\nSee this as an example:\r\n![image](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/86041826/44f2b0cc-c915-4903-bfe1-1bf90c342764)\r\n\r\nA better solution would be to implement word-wrapping instead, but it has to maintain new lines that are present in the strings (after the previous modification), like in the case of the Master Demonologist talent that should look like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/86041826/217dd9d5-b75f-42ca-9d7e-a1320974ffbf)\r\nPerhaps the same word-wrapping code as used in the talent calculator can be used here.\r\n\r\nYet another issue, probably unrelated to those above, is that the inspect talents window does not update on target change. Other tabs in the inspect window do update, but to update the talents window, one has to click on the character tab first, and then go back to the talents tab, which forces it to update.\r\nTo replicate this:\r\n1 - Inspect another player and click on the  talents tab\r\n2 - While the talents tab is open, click on another player\r\n3 - The talents tab should update as other do, but doesn't\r\n4 - To make it update, click on the character tab, then back to talents tab.\r\n\r\nAnother error that sometimes occurs when inspecting the talents of other players is that the talents windows triggers an error in Turtle_InspectTalentsUI/InspectTalentsFrame.lua:2505: attempt to index field `?' (a nil value), although it doesn't happen as much with my updates to the file, as it's probably triggered by talents that are originally missing.\r\n\r\nA short clip to illustrate some of this:\r\nhttps://streamable.com/imi3xz\r\n\r\nIn addition, sometimes the entire tree of the inspected player is showing question marks, as if the game can't find the icon to each talent. I've only seen this happen when inspecting players who are seemingly away. It almost never happens when inspecting players who are moving or have recently moved. \r\n\r\nLet me know if it's better to post this as separate issues.

The issue with Den Mother's Ravage is that it works at a seemingly infinite range, allowing it to stun from a distance and making the fight exceedingly challenging for ranged classes that are unable to properly kite, and get their spells interrupted from afar from a high damage attack (30+ dmg on leather). This causes Den Mother to have an exceptionally high kill count : the hill leading to her den is littered with corpses and lvl 20+ HC graves.

This seems to only be an issue with my specific character, as I have attempted to show this to other players and they do not have the same issue, but can witness me having this issue. When my character (Jamaikib, femme troll hunter) attempts to enter Dustwind Cave in Durotar, she becomes unable to engage in combat. Her first combat hit generally hits, but all subsequent hits are misses or absorbs. I also brought this to the attention of GMs and demonstrated this bug to GM Waldt, who witnessed me attempting to kill several mobs within the cave. They advised me to exit the game, delete my WDB folder, and then restart the game. I did so, and still experienced this bug. This happens to ALL mobs existing within the cave, and ranged mobs are still able to target and hit me, but I cannot hit them, similar to when a mob has lost its target and is returning to its patrol location, but the mob remains targeting and attacking me while I am unable to damage it. Other players are also able to witness me missing in combat, and are able to engage in combat normally, including other hunters. No special actions or movements are required except for entering the cave. Mobs with the same names and IDs as mobs inside of the cave are able to be engaged in combat normally. If I attempt to engage a mob that is within the cave while I am on the outside of the cave, the same bug occurs, keeping me from damaging them.\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=\r\nItem: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=\r\nQuest: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=\r\nSpell: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=\r\nObject: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?object=\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

Go get a different totem\r\n\r\nItem: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=61292\r\nI'd look up the haste buff applied but DB is still down, sorry. \r\n\r\nA relic slot totem like this should be proc'ing more often to make it in anyway shape or form an alternative for elemental shaman. After thorough testing against totem of the storm, this is a direct damage decrease despite the item being of rarer quality and harder to get. From an enhancement point of view this seems just downright broken. A spell that has a long cooldown like storm strike should not have a proc rate this low, it will not feasibly be usable at all to enhancement shamans. \r\n\r\nPotential fixes: Fix the proc rate for either spell. Arguably the rate for lightning bolt doesn't need a huge increase, but currently it is too low. For storm strike it needs to be drastically increased. Another potential fix is to use chain lightning as the spell that can proc the haste buff for elemental, but the proc rate would still need to be increased a good deal more. \r\n\r\nThanks dev team!","updatedAt":"2023-12-05T03:33:34+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-12-05T03:33:34+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Mashadeve"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"SuqMadiqM8"},"body":"I dont know if they are supposed to drop at all, they are obtained via pickpocket from the shamans at 100% even if you're not on the quest (anymore).","createdAt":"2023-10-19T10:11:43+0200"}],"createdAt":"2023-10-16T21:10:27+0200","number":4777,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Sealed Azure Bag, level 50 Rogue quest.

I think this is a GREAT and CRUEL issue especially for poor heals like us. I have a suggestion on how this could be fixed - either normally, just fix it so it doesn't go away when one enters the instance Orrrrrrr a better option - make the spell CD refresh if Your prior champion loses the buff for some reason death or bug either way.

Taking the doll to Sen'jin village quest did work but I wasn't paying attention then to see if it actually gave reputation or not, but that isn't a daily afaik. My character is currently at 2800/3000 reputation, 200 short of reaching friendly with them. I turned in 60 wool cloth for its reputation gain to push it over to the friendly side, and I only received 650xp and no reputation for doing so.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I did the children's week quest thoroughly, turned in the Warden of the Horde quest and received 0 reputation. I am under the impression that it should give a faction wide reputation reward. Can't take a look at turtlewow database because it is shut down to not spoil the update contents, so I can't confirm if that is working as intended. Classic WoWhead, however, says that warden of the horde should give 200 horde reputation.\r\n\r\nDo any faction-wide reputation gains (You gained 50 reputation with horde etc) work right now? Is Revantusk troll reputation somehow breaking it? Cloth quartermaster turn-ins should give reputation, so it not giving to Revantusk trolls seems very fishy to me.\r\n\r\nWhat about quests that have a minimum revantusk troll reputation to appear? Are there any? Are they broken? Is there some fault in the revantusk reputation object(?) that returns errors whenever something tries to call it to increase the reputation?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n1. Do something that should give either revantusk troll or horde reputation.

But, after doing some testing, to be specific - I was hitting Target Dummy in OG with Rank 1 Lightning Bolt so my 6k mana pool would go down slower, I didnt get any proc at all. However, there was an Enhancement shammy next to me, equipped with the same ring, geared on elemental procs (items that give 1-5 elemental dmg on melee hit), and he had 100% uptime from [Wrath of Cenarius]. \r\nAnother class is Warlock, who benefits from that ring. All warlocks have DoT abilities and said that each DoT has a chance to proc [Wrath of Cenarius] ring and its pretty decent for them. Especially if you are going with SM/RUIN build.\r\n\r\nSo, my questions would be:\r\n\r\n1. Does it or does it not proc from casting spells?\r\n2. Does it proc only from melee spell hit such as described above.\r\n3. Does it proc only from DoTs?\r\n4. Why proc% is so misarable?

I dont understand why it cant proc more often, and if you think thats too OP (which is not) add some internal CD on procs.

As a matter of fact, the dagger instead only works when a druid changes forms and it takes 500 fire damage, meaning I believe both parts of the weapon effect, the sacrifice HP effect and the fire damage part, assuming the spell (Shapeshift) counts as the druid being the target of the spell.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\nEquip Ornate Bloodstone Dagger with the \"Elemental Cat Build\", which requires the following items: Incendosaur Skin Set (Gloves, Boots, Shoulders), Repaired Electro-Lantern. These are the core items, you can also equip Blazefury Medallion (Kazzak) and Hide of the Thunder Lizard (H) but are not a must. Use the dagger in main hand and test on any target.

These are the core items, you can also equip Blazefury Medallion (Kazzak) and Hide of the Thunder Lizard (H) but are not a must.\r\n2. Use the dagger in main hand and test on any target with melee attacks. Checking combat log will show that the dagger is not procing on the target, even tho the spell damage landed by the item procs does.  Spells WILL NOT proc the dagger effect either (Moonfire, Wrath, Starfire, Insect Swarm).\r\n3. Using Shapeshift abilities will make the druid take 500 damage from the dagger, both the sacrifice part of the dagger and the damage part, all taken as fire damage.\r\n\r\nJudging that Ornate Bloodstone Dagger has the same wording and effect as Blade of Eternal Darkness (Equip: Chance on landing a damaging spell to deal 100 Shadow damage and restore 100 mana to you), I would assume they should work close to the same extent. Even if it's not working with the \"Elemental Cat\" build, the dagger itself IT's NOT procing on spells either.

Describe how it should work:**\r\n\r\nNot having this item before it's a bit tricky to specify this, but if we are to take Blade of Eternal Darkness as an example, given they have the same wording, when you're attacking in shapeshift form using the stated gear from earlier, there should be a chance, when the spell damage provided by the items occur a proc on melee damage dealt (auto attacks, shred, claw) those magic damage procs SHOULD have a chance to proc the dagger effect. The dagger effect being sacrificing 250 of the playable character HP (most probably intended as fire damage, working as a form of life tap if you would) and dealing 250 fire damage to the target to which you had dealt the magic damage to. \r\n\r\nIf further materials are needed to fix this issues I will be happy to procure such materials.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, love the new patch, hope to see this issue fixed soon, I believe in the Dev Team <3\r\n","updatedAt":"2023-10-12T02:18:12+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-10-12T02:18:12+0200"},{"assignees":[{"login":"Dormilon"}],"author":{"login":"Azeron223"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"Muigin"},"body":"Confirmed.

Even if you saved the quests for Revered you still need to kill the vendor 1200 times.\r\n\r\nThis is Very bad game design and I got up to 1000 rep before I got reported to the GM's for griefing NPC's. Which is fine, I agree this is not good. \r\n\r\nSo all I'm asking is please let us grind to exalted Bloodsail Buccaneers Reputation by killing the Bruisers in Booty Bay, by enabled their rep gain up to exalted. Would still be a good grind but it doesn't inconvenience anyone killing guards unlike a vendor 4200 times. \r\n\r\nYou've even added rep rewards for exalted albeit rubbish ones, but this doesn't matter for completionists / exalted rep chasers, so you must intend people to get exalted, but the only way is through griefing a vendor for weeks. \r\n\r\nTL:DR\r\nEnable Bloodsail Buccaneers rep gain up until exalted from Booty Bay Bruisers, the only alternative is killing a vendor in Badlands 4200 times that people use alot and being told by the GM's to stop, making this rep grind Impossible.

I will elaborate ...\r\n\r\nContext: Normal Mode (not HC mode)\r\n\r\nThe quest initiates just fine, you talk to Dashel Stonefist and he summons his two thugs and starts attacking you. However, when I right clicked Dashel Stonefist, a \"talking animation\" like when you talk to any other npc displayed and no attack by my character was performed. Just to be extra clear, this happened while Dashel Stonefist and his thugs were already attacking and the fight was well underway.\r\n\r\nRight clicking again (while they are attacking and the fight started) only displayed another talking animation.\r\nI had to run away to abort the quest. Then I aborted the quest by deleting it from my quest log. And then I accepted it again.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did is try again to exclude any random flaking out of various scripts but I could reliably reproduce the exact bug.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I did is re-log. And then try again (orderly aborting the quest, deleting it form the quest log and launching it again). However, I could reproduce the exact bug reliably.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I did is re-log, delete the WDB folder and then try again (again, orderly aborting the quest, deleting it from the quest log and launching it again). However, I could reproduce the exact bug reliably.\r\n\r\nUpon right clicking Dashel Stonefist once the fight started and he summons his thugs and starts attacking a talking animation displayed. And even waiting a little while and letting him attack does not change this. I could wait for half a minute or even a minute, right clicking him during the fight (when you are supposed to fight back) always displayed a talking animation. I suspect that this happened because the npc did not turn hostile (as can be seen by the name plate of the npc remaining yellow instead of turning red) even though the npc was attacking my character.\r\n\r\nI was in the end able to complete the quest by activating an ability (crusader strike) on the npc Dashel Stonefist. That turned him hostile (as could be seen by his name plate changing from yellow to red) and then I could properly right click him to attack him and complete the quest.\r\n\r\nI have never seen this kind of bug before, it happened only today. I ran the quest on other character just fine, I do not know why it happened like this.\r\n\r\nI suspect that it happened because the npc for some reason did not turn hostile when the npc starts attacking. Its name plate remained yellow (as opposed to turning red) even during the fight while the npc and his thugs are attacking. I was advised to report my findings here (even if it turns out that it might not be a bug and perhaps latency related) so I am filing this report.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the npc did not reset properly somehow between interactions.\r\nIt could also be internet latency related (this bug occurred when the server was under extreme load).\r\nLastly it could have been caused by players being nearby and possibly attempting to run the quest (I am mentioning this because other players were in the vicinity standing in front of the npc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_On an unrelated note, is this quest supposed to pvp-flag players? I am asking because the quest force-flags players to pvp. I thought that quests like this were changed to no longer force-flag people to prevent HC griefing._\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Initiate the quest \"The Missing Diplomat\" by talking to Dashel Stonefist and accepting the quest where you have to fight and defeat him.\r\n2. When the fight starts and he summons his thugs attempt to right click Dashel Stonefist with your cursor\r\n3.

It worked that way any other time I ran the quest so I don't know why it literally bugged out this time. Maybe it was serverload/latency, or maybe it was a freak accident.
