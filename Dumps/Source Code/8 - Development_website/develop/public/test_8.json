I bought it back from the Ratchet City NPC, but it doesn't show the eyeball axe I sold. I am very important to this weapon team. It took a long time for the 40 person team to obtain it, and there were not many on the entire server. Our union only has my own weapon, which is also a graduation weapon for my character. It is important to me and the team. I immediately contacted you if the weapon I discovered within half an hour of last night was missing, but it has not been resolved. I am quite old in grade and I love World of Warcraft very much. The environment in the Turtle server is the last time I have played Warcraft.

Describe how it should work:**\r\nSo here is the deal in regards to partial resists, as of right now I'm mostly healing and I cannot confirm these things firsthand. However I have guildmates who are well overgeared in both pve and pvp cases and they experiencing an absurd amount of partial resists. Things like thunderfury fully or partially resisting more often than it should, mages with over 70 spell penetration in pvp getting double partial resist or full resists against green geared players. The most recent instance that was caught is death coil being fully resisted. It is a binary spell, and as such it can only hit or miss. Neither critical hits nor partial resists are possible. However items like storm gauntlets have a 100% proc chance and are added to your melee attack, so if your melee hit doesn't land ( dodged, parry, miss etc.). It won't be applied. I have never seen it resist, do partial or even miss. It can crit and is not modified by spellpower, only by spellcrit chance. However the target can be immune to the damage type, hence why a lost of paladin are using 2 sets of gloves for those cases. \r\n","updatedAt":"2024-03-03T08:17:45+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2024-03-03T07:57:22+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"jackbrundage97"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"ratkosrb"},"body":"Could you possibly have been in a raid group?","createdAt":"2024-03-03T05:43:43+0100"},{"author":{"login":"jackbrundage97"},"body":"> Could you possibly have been in a raid group?\r\n\r\nNow I feel silly, I'm pretty sure this was the case","createdAt":"2024-03-03T15:16:21+0100"}],"createdAt":"2024-03-03T05:07:46+0100","number":6415,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Didn't get credit for The Royal Rescue quest in BRD despite keeping Princess alive","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

When both boots and trinket are put on you should get sum of their bonuses, so 116 value.\r\n\r\n## Motivation for that change\r\n1. As i saw after openning issue it actually related to #5126, but i think twow is about vanilla + experience. If i remember correctly some time ago + mounted speed bonuses didnt stack in the past, for 2 trinkets, but they do now. Also we got more speed boosts for mounted players - like mithrill spurs vs thorium spurs, i think its time to go to original design of this item, i didnt find any complains of people about this item being too op or somehow bad for community.\r\n2. Also it would be coherent behavior with other speed increasing trinkets, for example - mount speed increase trinkets. If you put on gloves enchants + thorium spurs + carrot trinket + goblin car key trinket - they all stack up and give sum bonus to speed.\r\n3. Even for increase swim speed bonus it works same way, if you put on Azure Slik Belt and Murlock's Flippers which also have + swim speed bonus, this values stack and you swim with speed equal to 100+ both of their bonuses.\r\n4.  Everyone loves speed, it would make this item truly great trinket and balance out current meta around Gelkis vs Magram.\r\n5. Simmilar quest with Magrams provides Dyad of Twitching Elven Ears which is great for stealth users, it would be fair if Gelkis allies also get something usefull - trinket that stacks speed with boots would be realy good for stealth users which would provide additionaly speed for their stealth movement. Giving both questlines usefullness parity.\r\n6. It wouldn't affect pvp or pve balance that much but would really increase value of item and motivation of players to participate in this questline. \r\n7. Alot of buffs and effects are present in game already which increase movement speed for greater values. Think of [Swiftness of Zanza](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=23796) for example. So even with stacked bonus player will have running speed increased less then Zanza provides.\r\n8. This quest item is available for both factions in any given moment, so it doesn't discriminate agains any group of players.\r\n9. Literaly in description of item it says that it does \"Minor increase to running and swimming speed\" which player with boots enchant just doesnt observe at all. Imagine dissapointment of player who farmed so much reputation, did all quests, choose this trinket and saw its basically not working.\r\n\r\n## Additional thought \r\nIt would be great if devs can also check if Dyad of Twitching Elven Ears + stealth detection bonus stacks with all other + stealth detection bonuses, cause if it is not - it should be.\r\n\r\n","updatedAt":"2024-02-28T07:53:20+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2024-02-28T07:53:19+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"tasipeter3000"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"tasipeter3000"},"body":"![WoWScrnShot_022724_192714](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/156001406/f1d40c0e-f5f8-42a3-955a-48fe0456138e)\r\n","createdAt":"2024-02-27T19:28:24+0100"},{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"The mountpoint of a transmogged weapon will inherit the base wep, not the visually used wep.

I manually removed all the games that finished prematurely due to lack of players. And analyzed colors of final bg screen for the results of match.\r\n\r\nTake this stats with grain of salt cause it's only my timezone and i didn't participated in all possible games. But it displays some of player experience on server. \r\nOnly 40 games are presented in gif because of github size restrictions. Which color is more present: the blue or the red one?\r\n![av](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/16599015/04084686-e02e-4d9a-a1c4-ef25ec65c40f)\r\n\r\nSo what did we learn from the stats you ask?\r\nHere is the plot of horde vs alliance wins over all analyzed games:\r\n![Figure_1](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/16599015/6ac0bd8a-497a-4e67-bd1c-7bcda50c7e9b)\r\n\r\n## In total\r\nAlliance wins: **165**\r\nHorde wins: **95**\r\nSo horde wins only in **36.53%** of cases while alliance wins **63.47%** of games.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms you are likely to **lose** at least **2 games** as horde to **win one** game.\r\nI was lucky enough to get in av with horde premades, which provided a few streaks of horde winning over alliance. But this luxury isnt available for all horde players participating in this battle ground. So average win rate can be even lower than my personal experience.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of experience, turtle wow is all about it. And what can affect it more than lose streak? So i calculated longest win streaks and lose streaks in this 260 games. Longest win streak for **alliance is 19 games in a row**! And longest win streak for **horde is only 9 games in a row**. Now imagine playing horde and participating in av while losing AV 19 times in a row! Even if you play 5 AV per day is **_4 days of losing without winning_**. You would think AV just cant be win by horde by this time.\r\n\r\nI think this numbers suggest the need of balance changes on av. It can be done in different ways. But map rebalance is the easiest to implement, doesn't affect other gameplay mechanics such as pve and helps to avoid upsetting certain classes with nerfs.\r\n\r\nPS. for anyone interested i can provide all 260 screenshots of game stats and all the Python code i used to make chart/gif.\r\n","createdAt":"2024-02-25T17:52:11+0100"},{"author":{"login":"ratkosrb"},"body":"I'll add a few additional invisible walls that should prevent this route.","createdAt":"2024-02-25T21:32:57+0100"},{"author":{"login":"jalicsg"},"body":"Hello Melg8,\r\n\r\nAs you have wide variety of stats.\r\nJust out of curiosity.\r\nCan you please provide stats for games taken on AV day with full team?\r\n\r\nSo not 26v22 and not normal days.\r\n\r\nOr just provide all the screenshots I will filter them myself.\r\nMatches where one side had more players (at least by +4/+5) should be ignored imo.\r\n\r\nThank you.","createdAt":"2024-02-26T10:32:50+0100"},{"author":{"login":"melg8"},"body":"@jalicsg  sure! \r\nI removed all games that had <40 people on any of sides. \r\nI removed all games that had >=4 people difference between sides.\r\nSo 39/39 games were removed as well as 41 vs 37 were removed.\r\nIn total i got 158 games out of 260 so 60% of full games set were full games.\r\nWe got such stats:\r\nAlliance wins: 94\r\nHorde wins: 64\r\nLongest alliance win streak: 15\r\nLongest alliance lose streak: 9\r\nSo horde side got 40.5% winrate in such sample.\r\n\r\n![Figure_2](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/16599015/8a544a5c-0dba-46ef-8754-55e685c6ffcb)\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out my brand new #6362 issue for more AV jumps ;P \r\n\r\nAlso as you asked - full set of cropped screenshots is available here: https://file.io/d7R92cFEMTV3","createdAt":"2024-02-26T14:21:30+0100"},{"author":{"login":"jalicsg"},"body":"Is the URL correct?

This makes defence unreliable and moves all pvp interaction to the smallest part of land behind fences. Nothing like that is present on alliance base. So while alliance can hold they ground near bridge, horde lacks ways to prevent this abusive attacks even if they are recalling for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Multiple reports on issue\r\n1.

I'm suggesting dev team finally look into this matter. \r\n\r\nI want to notice that this fixes arent something terribly new to begin with. First of all suggested fixes were implemented in older av map before av rework although this map had other backdoor jumps issues. So rework fixed old backdoor jumps but introduced new one for horde side only.\r\n\r\nAlso there were fast and effective fixes of map already implemented by dev team after my issue [here](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/4114) for alliance side. Now its time for horde side!\r\n\r\n\r\n# So how palas should do it tho?\r\nHere you go, full sequence, as I have promised! (Credit for video goes to [Tendies](https://forum.turtle-wow.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=72708))\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/16599015/8920bb05-8c86-457a-8cee-734fe66f8f5d\r\n\r\n# Whats wrong with it?\r\n\r\n1. It skips all bottom half of base by just going over the fence\r\n2. While mounted you lose melee npc aggro right around tower so you good to go now...\r\n3. Archers from both towers are in los position while you stand behind tower/fence so you are not attacked by any archers.\r\n6. When running forward into base - there is no nps that will aggro up to flag itself\r\n7. You dont need any cooldowns used for this to work, no need for bubble, nothing\r\n8. Additionally this fence cant be penetrated by ranged attacks or by melee hits, so even when players are recalling to defend - they can attack alliance cause they just hide behind fence/tree making choke point defence untill they gather high enough number of players to do final blow.\r\n\r\nSo in total we get unlimited supply of people streaming down this \"pipe\" not getting damaged by npcs, not getting combat status and having place to gather critical mass (like 7 of them in picture above) when recalling will be not effective after they get hut flag.\r\n\r\nAlso it opens drednaught tank classes ways to solo cap hut. They just run mounted whole route, and after that kill everything on flag - kiting elite and capping flag in the end.\r\n\r\nBecause of this exploit on map 8 of 10 games finish into alliance winning just because horde base is open to be ambushed by any amount of alliance players without any slowing down factos. While horde will struggle to cross over bridge getting spammed by archers and other npcs.\r\n\r\nBecause of this exploit alot of good pvp players just refuse to recall and defend base, cause they see how outnumbered they are each time.\r\n\r\n# Suggestions\r\n\r\n1. Add same invisible wall as were added to alliance side after [this issue](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/4114) at tower part of backdoor route. So when people try to cross tower wall part they just slide downhill. This will be even less intrusive than on alliance side where you can observe invisible wall preventing you from casting to people.\r\n![╨╕╨╖╨╛╨▒╤Ç╨░╨╢╨╡╨╜╨╕╨╡](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/16599015/9390784c-395b-4730-afad-6f0c0174c8e3)\r\nThis would be main fix for issue, even if others not implemented, this would resolve part of problem.\r\n\r\n2.

Yet even this farm, which appears very tedious on retail ( you can only get 5 rep per Booty Bay npc killed there ), is bugged on Turtle.\r\n Shakes O'Breen, the ship's captain in Faldir's Cove, is supposed to have a 5-30 seconds respawn to compensate for the low rep gain (both factions are used in the \"Insane in the Membrane\" achievement on retail ). On Turtle it's 5 mins like any other NPC, which makes grinding from hated to neutral utterly impossible.\r\n","updatedAt":"2024-02-28T07:50:37+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"6556004"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-23T16:50:56+0100","number":6344,"labels":"Client","state":"OPEN","title":"Maexxna's Fang has incorrect texture","body":"Item: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=22804\r\n\r\n![w - σë»µ£¼](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/117788167/d35f8716-aa29-4628-94c4-f8ef485df3f8)\r\n![1](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/117788167/d0bfe067-e67c-4d86-b3f8-6fb3a855fe89)\r\n\r\nThe wrong texture knife_1h_stratholme_d_03(Harbinger of Doom: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=23044) is used in the ItemDisplayInfo.dbc file\r\nCorrect solution texture number: knife_1h_stratholme_d_01\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updatedAt":"2024-03-02T15:13:00+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Menethiltt"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-23T16:10:19+0100","number":6343,"labels":"","state":"OPEN","title":"Guild Warehouse grid missing","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\nGuild Warehouse grid missing - Guild warehouses opened at 18:00 will be deleted after being saved, including the materials inside\r\n\r\n![1](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/158516329/51b2ea07-64b3-4efd-9e9c-0fc0827258d9)\r\n![2](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/158516329/3d07454c-f2af-4f12-a606-e7d7d293c88d)\r\n![3](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/158516329/607b0a49-08a1-4f8a-832e-9b2650872e67)\r\n\r\n","updatedAt":"2024-02-23T16:10:19+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Menethiltt"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"English only in the tracker.","createdAt":"2024-02-23T14:56:06+0100"},{"author":{"login":"Menethiltt"},"body":"Σ╕ìΦâ╜σñäτÉåσÉù∩╝ƒ","createdAt":"2024-02-23T15:03:49+0100"},{"author":{"login":"Menethiltt"},"body":"Σ╕ìΦâ╜σñäτÉåσÉù∩╝ƒ","createdAt":"2024-02-23T15:05:14+0100"},{"author":{"login":"Menethiltt"},"body":"Σ╗ÇΣ╣êµäÅµÇ¥σòè","createdAt":"2024-02-23T15:26:34+0100"}],"createdAt":"2024-02-23T14:54:39+0100","number":6342,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"σà¼Σ╝ÜΣ╗ôσ║ôΘí╡Θ¥óσÅêΦó½σÉ₧µÄëΣ║å","body":"σà¼Σ╝ÜπÇèτê▒Σ╗ÄΘ¢╢σ╝ÇσºïπÇïσà¼Σ╝ÜΣ╗ôσ║ôτ¼¼σ¢¢µá╝1µ£ê26µùÑτö¿σà¼Σ╝ÜΣ╗ôσ║ô1500GΦ┤¡Σ╣░τÜäτ¼¼σ¢¢Σ╕¬Σ╗ôσ║ôµá╝σ¡É1µ£ê26µùÑµÖÜΘçìσÉ»σÉÄτ£ïσ░▒µ▓íµ£ëΣ║å σîàµï¼σ¡ÿσ£¿ΘçîΘ¥óτÜä10τ╗äτë╣µòêµ│òσè¢Φì»µ░┤ Σ╣ƒµ▓íµ£ëΘÇÇσ¢₧Θçæσ╕ü Σ╗ôσ║ôτÜäΣ╜┐τö¿Φ«░σ╜òΣ╣ƒµ▓íΣ║å\r\nµ»Åµ¼íµ£ìσèíσÖ¿µ¢┤µû░µêæΘâ╜Σ╝ÜΦ┐╜Θù« Σ╕Çτ¢┤Σ╕ìτ╗Öµ¡úΘ¥óτ¡öσñì σûèτ¡ëσ╛àτ¡ëσ╛à ΦªüΣ╣êσ░▒µèèµêæσìòσ¡ÉµëôµÄë\r\nµêæσ░▒σ╜ôσñäτÉåΣ╕ìΣ║åΣ║åΣ╕ìΦªüΘéú1500GσÆîΦì»µ░┤Σ║å\r\nσÅ»µÿ»Σ╗èσñ⌐2024σ╣┤2µ£ê23µùÑΣ╕ïσìê18:56σ╝ÇσÉ»Σ║åσà¼Σ╝ÜΣ╗ôσ║ôτ¼¼5µá╝ µ£ìσèíσÖ¿τé╕σÉÄσ¢₧µíúσÅêΦó½σÉ₧µÄëΣ║å \r\n![1](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/158516329/8ecd6977-f15d-4812-8eac-a776132531b8)\r\n![2](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/158516329/5240870a-7d95-49bf-a015-859de0cc8164)\r\nσîàµï¼Σ╗ôσ║ôΘçîτÜäµ¥ÉµûÖ]\r\n![3](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/158516329/2d8161dc-c09e-4241-b035-d011f8b9152f)\r\nΦâ╜Σ╕ìΦâ╜Φºúσå│","updatedAt":"2024-02-23T15:26:35+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2024-02-23T14:56:06+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"MincyALot"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"I replicated the lack of a drop table for 164888. 164883 is not a valid ID.","createdAt":"2024-02-28T08:10:11+0100"}],"createdAt":"2024-02-23T11:25:37+0100","number":6341,"labels":"Object, Reproduced, Loot Table","state":"OPEN","title":"Felwood Whipper Root Tubers unobtainable","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\nFelwood Cleansed Root Tubers disappear after using them and don't give the Whipper Root Tuber item.\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

A friend asked my to craft him some thorium spurs so I went to the anvil in orgrimmar to craft them. I accidently right clicked on Krathok Moltenfist, who is near the anvil, and at the bottom of his text window there was a option to click/choose something along the lines of \"I wish to be an armorsmith\". Me already being an armorsmith, having done the quest previously, clicked on it to see what would happen.  \r\n\r\nI was stripped of my blacksmithing/armorsmithing knowledge but then immediately relearned the professions(armorsmithing and blacksmithing). Unfortunately, every single schematic I learned from the trainers is now gone, and every single schematic that was armorsmithing specific is now gone from my list as well. The only schematics I appear to still have now are the ones that I learned that were not learned from a trainer nor was armorsmithing specific.  This is very unfortunate since I previously had some very rare and also some very expensive armorsmithing schematics.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

Describe how it should work:**\r\n\r\nIF someone is already an armorsmith, when someone talks to Krathok Moltenfist and chooses \"I wish to be an armorsmith\" option, nothing should happen. Even better, if someone is already an armorsmith, the option shouldn't even be there. If this is an intentional mechanic for non armorsmiths, you'd think there would be a warning after saying that all your skills will be wiped. I had no way of knowing this would happen.  \r\n\r\nWhen you even talk to Krathok Moltenfist he even says in his text \"Be warned, <adventurer>. Once the choice is made and the tasks required is completed - there is no going back. One can only walk down one path.\".

The dailies were removed from Silvermoon rep in 17.1 release. However, the Revantusk trolls reputation still have daily quests to earn rep. Silvermoon has runecloth donations.

I have completed every single quest I could find for the reputation that isn't either cancelled or deprecated. \r\nThe point is, turning in a stack of 20 runecloth to silvermoon gives 50 rep per stack.

The material cost is about 120G, and the enchantment foundry fee is 12G.I logged in again on the afternoon of February 5th and found that the [Great Sword of Evil Power] item disappeared from my account. I had already gone to the Ratchet City NPC to check. There was no [Great Sword of Evil Power] item, and I clearly remembered this. I didn't sell or destroy the item, I just transformed it, and it mysteriously disappeared from me the next day\r\n\r\n 3.

The UI shows your bar as a cast time of 1.5 seconds on wrath but using stop watch time trials and video review every cast is 2 seconds when it should be 1.5 seconds with wrath. AND starfire is casting at 3.5 seconds when it should be casting at 3 seconds with improved starfire.\r\n\r\nI started figuring this out while doing 5 time trials of each wrath and starfire.  I began thinking that the problem was nature's grace not actually giving you the speed. I found my actual average cast time of wrath to be 1.65-1.76 seconds depending on numbers of crit. and expected time was 1.32-1.43seconds average cast time based on crits. Similar problem with starfire with an average actual cast time of 3.21-3.24 seconds per cast despite 17.6-18.8% crits.  Trial data attached.\r\n\r\nThere is a small chance that the system is actually registering 2 second normal cast on wrath and 1 second following a crit. As well, 3.5 second regular starfire followed by 2.5 second starfire after crit. If you enter these values into my trial the expected and actual are within 2-3% of expected total cast time on a trial of ~30 spells. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

Separating the 4 Death Knights requires a Druid (possibly other healers could also work). In Thaddius' room, after everyone enters the 4 Death Knights' room, gather in the bottom left corner. When the hunter pulls Thane Korth'azz, the Druid steps into the poison water, then heals themselves fully. This way, the other 3 Death Knights are attracted over. After killing Thane Korth'azz, the Druid jumps onto the platform where Thaddius is located. This causes the 3 Death Knights to reset due to lack of pathing, leaving only 3 upon return.\r\n![WoWScrnShot_021024_004553](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/27480126/ba3cb32b-17fd-440a-9794-575b1769dca0)\r\n![WoWScrnShot_021024_004620](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/27480126/78cd5d0a-46a4-4dce-ad13-f7cbfa527723)\r\n\r\n10.Patchwerk \r\n11.Grobbulus \r\n12.Gluth \r\n13.Thaddius \r\n### 14.Sapphiron \r\n\r\n- [x] In the battle against Sapphiron, use the Christmas tree to dodge the ice orbs.The damage from the aura seems to have weakened; it used to be every 2 seconds.in actual combat, it's every 3 seconds\r\n\r\n![5](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/27480126/5d220aff-2215-4a85-929c-04269f06640c)\r\n\r\n### 15.Kel'Thuzad \r\n\r\n- [x] 1.

I have run DPSmate for tracking and our guild runs an independent logging program that records everyoneΓÇÖs damage as well. Both recordings show the same miss rate on boss encounters from our AQ40 raid. IΓÇÖve also been reviewing logs from BWL from DPSmate of my own spells, warlocks, and mages.\r\n\r\nTotal 6% hit + 3% spell hit from talent Natural Weapons talent. Bosses are to have 17% miss which can be overcome up to 16% hit cap. I should be missing about 7-8%. In raids over all bosses, I am missing 10.3-11.8% between both Starfire and wrath on tests over 100s of hits. This is also reflective of some boss target dummy runs as well.\r\n\r\nI since recorded another BWL run with an average of 10.8% miss on bosses. In this run I received Neltharion's tear (2% hit tricket) and I ran an Onyxia after. My now total is 8% hit + 3% spell hit from natural weapons talent = +11% hit. On Onyxia I missed 8.5% now (about 2% less miss now). This is still far off from the expected 5-6% hit.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.Login to your test server on a balance druid with talents : https://talents.turtle-wow.org/druid/V0X08Z9V-0-U5D6\r\n2. Put on this gear\r\n\r\n- 5 pc Genesis (+3% hit)\r\n- Choker of the fire lord\r\n- Cloak of consumption (+1% hit)\r\n- Bracers of accuracy (+1% hit)\r\n- gloves of spell mastery\r\n- Mana igniting cord\r\n- dragonslayerΓÇÖs signet\r\n- Band of forced concentration (1% hit)\r\n- Corrupt reed\r\n- Eye of the beast\r\n- Staff of shadowflame\r\n\r\n4. Become immortal\r\n5. Shoot BWL or AQ40 bosses - 100+ times with each starfire and wrath.\r\n6. Review logs\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\n\r\nI have reviewed logs of my guilds mages, and they see 0-0.7% miss in raid. They do have 6% + hit in talent and more hit gear, but they are +15% hit with talents and gear combined.  I reviewed logs with a destruction warlock in my guild and he has +9% hit and our logs showed him at 5.5% miss.\r\n\r\nConclusion: I think the most likely reason for my significantly elevated miss is Natural weapon talent may not be functioning for spell hit. \r\n\r\n** Further comments **\r\n\r\nIf a question is raised about spell resist and penetration, all bosses in AQ40 and BWL (except Chromaggus) according to your data based have 15 spell resist to nature and Arcane. Further I have 40 spell penetration in my set. It is rumored that the twow engine cannot overcome the last 15 resist and caps at 15 and not zero even with spell pen. I cannot confirm this. At 15 spell resistance (if it is not capable of being reduced to zero) I donΓÇÖt believe it has even 1% chance of a full resist. I believe it technically can only 25%,50%, or 75% resist.\r\n\r\n","updatedAt":"2024-02-08T10:42:30+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2024-02-08T10:42:20+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"kevinwxl"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"Please contact support.","createdAt":"2024-02-08T10:30:04+0100"}],"createdAt":"2024-01-30T17:05:00+0100","number":6147,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"BIG BUG!! we just appied 3 weeks for this bug!!no any respond!!!","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.Serve∩╝Üchinese asia----ravenshire    guild:Φ»╕τÑ₧σñ£\r\n2. issue: We can't see the second page of our guild bank, nor can we use the items in it, including a full warehouse of potions.\r\n3. we just appied 3 weeks for this problem to GM online.but no any respond for us !\r\nmy email 82462138@qq.com\r\nty for your helping!\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=\r\nItem: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=\r\nQuest: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=\r\nSpell: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=\r\nObject: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?object=\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

If this value is incorrect it may also affect ability swift mend when consuming the HoT.\r\n\r\nClassic wow formula for a calculating any heal. Below values are for regrowth:\r\nRegrowth Direct: ```(2/3.5)*(2/3.5) / (2/3.5 + 15/15) = 18.65%```\r\nRegrowth HoT: ```(15/15)*(15/15) / (2/3.5 + 15/15) = 63.63% (9,09% per tick) (7)```\r\n\r\nAbilities have been tested on rank 7, 8, and 9 and all have 7% ticks.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. See spell tool tip for rank's base healing over time (example rank 7 : 861 over 21 seconds = 123 heal per 3 seconds (7 ticks)\r\n2. Equip a given level of healing value. My example was 513 healing. Which should calculate as: 513 healing power * 0.0909 = 46.63 per tick = 169.6 (rounds to 170) per tick. However actual test results in 159 healing which is to say 513 healing power *0.07 + 123 = 158.9 (159 rounding)\r\n3.

The method of using a Paladin healing Warlock to draw aggro shines in Naxxramas and is widely used in many boss fights, such as Kel'Thuzad's Phase 2 and the Harvester Thork fight.\"\r\n![1](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/27480126/9fc200c4-d261-4cff-97b2-ce7cc1ce02e9)\r\n![2](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/27480126/0c5970d1-d938-4f28-8397-5137ae364bc6)\r\n![3](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/27480126/7770b1bc-d34e-4d0e-aaa1-0b0ca5aa6285)\r\n![4](https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/assets/27480126/fe297537-4fb7-423a-b70b-cbc67eff20b5)\r\n\r\n2.\"In the battle with Loatheb, give the Soulstone to the Paladin and have the Paladin interfere with the Priest; neither will receive the debuff of Necrotic Aura.\"\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=\r\nItem: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=\r\nQuest: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=\r\nSpell: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=\r\nObject: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?object=\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

But no Silvermoon Remnants reputation reward. The same should be true for Horde rewards - no Revantusk reputation is gained. I was at 2112/6000 reputation with Silvermoon Remnant before turn-in and have that same number after the turn-in. My character was a human so they gain extra reputation due to diplomacy racial, the numbers indicated were 55 alliance and 13 Stormwind/Ironforge/Gnomeregan/Darnassus, so it might be double-dipping by first increasing Alliance 50 -> 55, then if it's 20% of that 55 to be 11 for the subfactions, that also get multiplied by 1.1 to then be 12.1 rounded up to 13 for humans?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Chinese New Year / Lunar Festival event\r\n2. Talk to a festival elder with a quest that you haven't yet collected and turn it in\r\n3.  Gain rewards.\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC:\r\nElder Bladeswift\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15598\r\nThere are a lot more Lunar Festival elders, but listing them all individually is fairly pointless.\r\n\r\nQuest: \r\nBladeswift the Elder\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=8718\r\nEach of the elders have their own turn-in quest with its own data entry, listing them all seems fairly pointless.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\nIt is debatable what the intent of the reputation reward for the event is. Classic/Vanilla didn't have the custom reputation factions: Silvermoon Remnants and Revantusk Trolls. But to me, gaining an Alliance or Horde reputation should indicate reputation gain to all the subfactions that it comprises of and this should include the Silvermoon and Revantusk factions, but for some reason, it has not been made so. This leads me to believe that this deep into the game's life cycle, a decision has probably been made to not include them for some reason, not sure if it's due to vanilla/classic having not included those, so therefore neither should TWoW, or if there is some other reasoning behind it. However, for all intents and purposes, this looks like a bug, so I am reporting it, even if it may very well be working as intended. Other sources that give faction-wide reputation (Alliance or Horde) are probably equally bugged with regards to not giving Silvermoon or Revantusk reputations. If you add these factions to the Alliance reputation and Horde reputation code, it should be a blanket fix for all individual 'bugged' reputation rewards out there, probably.","updatedAt":"2024-02-09T03:07:29+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Creedastic"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"Duplicate of https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/6105","createdAt":"2024-02-09T03:09:12+0100"}],"createdAt":"2024-01-26T10:20:29+0100","number":6106,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Whip Lashers buff/bug","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:** \r\n\r\nWhip Lashers in Dire Maul East deal a lot more damage than they used to do compared to the past.

She dropped Blackstone Ring. Was unable to pick it up, because it is treated as 'unique' and I already owned one. Should it be unique-equipped instead, because I'd imagine that people would still wish to vendor it even if they loot a duplicate one?

Describe how it should work:**\r\nIt seems awfully artificial that the reality prevents your hero from looting a ring from an enemy they slay, because they happen to already have one, either on their person or in their bank. There's a category of equipment known as 'unique-equipped', which means you can only wear one of them, even if you are able to own multiple ones, you tend to see it in rings, trinkets, and one-handed weapons - basically in gear that you have multiple slots it is eligible for. To be fair, I can't recall if unique-equipped was added later on, and maybe wasn't there in vanilla... Doing a quick look on wowhead, it looks like there are total of 25 unique-equipped items in classic, and 414 in TBC, so it was probably added later on in the dev cycle nearing the end of vanilla, maybe? In fact, looking at the TBC version of Blackstone ring, it has been changed to unique-equipped from unique.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm not sure if this could be regarded as a bug or working as intended. There are certainly arguments for either case. Mainly, that it should stay as unique because it was unique in vanilla and only changed in TBC. On the other hand, TBC rectified some mistakes (bugs/overlooked issues etc) that were present in vanilla, and changing it to unique-equipped could have been a change made because players discovered that if they own the ring, they cannot loot it again, adding a 'worthless' drop to Princess's drop pool if they didn't have the ability to disenchant it on the fly. I would argue that unique treasures should probably be made unique-equipped instead for the most part, simply because of how horrible it feels if you have to leave the treasure behind because of such a limitation. They are bind on pickup gear from dungeon bosses, so you can't really get them to a player character who wasn't there to loot it when the boss was killed, so vendoring and disenchanting seem to be the most common solutions to deal with soulbound unique-equipped items you can't wear.","updatedAt":"2024-01-07T22:42:53+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2024-01-07T22:42:52+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"balakethelock"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"Fixed in 1.17.2.

However, the debuff never goes above 2 stacks. Also, the damage is not correlating to the tooltip information. The tooltip says it \"**deals 100 Nature damage over 12 secs. Stacks up to 5 times.**\". The damage ticks every 3 seconds which means the first stack should be doing 4 ticks of 25 damage (100, in total). The second stack should be doing 4 ticks of 50 damage (200, in total). However, in reality, the 1st and 2nd stacks are ticking for 30 and 60 damage, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n1. Druid (feral form) with nothing equipped except for Vial of Potent Venoms.\r\n2. Attack a Stormwind Expert or Apprentice Training Dummy for a sustained period of time (e.g. 10+ minutes).\r\n3. The debuff will never exceed 2 stacks even though you can hear the sound effect suggesting that another dose of poison has been applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\nExpert Training Dummy - https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=50516\r\nApprentice Training Dummy - https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=50515\r\nVial of Potent Venoms (ID - 61243) - https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=61243\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\nAt one stack, I expect the damage-over-time effect to tick for 25, four times (100, in total).\r\nAt two stacks, I expect the damage-over-time effect to tick for 50, four times (200, in total).\r\nAt three stacks, I expect the damage-over-time effect to tick for 75, four times (300, in total).\r\nAt four stacks, I expect the damage-over-time effect to tick for 100, four times (400, in total).\r\nAt five stacks, I expect the damage-over-time effect to tick for 125, four times (500, in total).\r\n\r\nI've tested this using my druid (feral form) for about 30 minutes on a Stormwind expert/apprentice training dummy and the proc rate is around 20%. Combine this with the fast attack speed of cat form (~1 attack per second), it is quite likely to to get another proc without the damage-over-time effect falling off. Therefore, I would reliably expect to reach five stacks and be able to maintain it for very long periods of time.","updatedAt":"2024-01-03T13:50:13+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2024-01-03T13:50:13+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Pet-Slime"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"Thank you for the extremely detailed replication steps.

Priests give a shield so the damage is gradual, hijal paladin uses a weak ability to gradually bring the value to minimum. A berserk command is given on discord. The hil then reduces the bear's health to the required value and gives the ability to bubble.

I'm playing Balance and generally in Moonkin Form during the encounter - I do not have Berserk talented. \r\n\r\nWhen hit by Burning Adrenaline, I moved away from the raid as per the encounter, exploded, and found that after the rest of the group had wiped I still had aggro, but could not move or use abilities, could not release my spirit, and kept my active buffs. Hard-quitting out of the game with Alt-F4 reset my state and the encounter, putting me back at the graveyard in the normal dead state when I logged back in.\r\n\r\nHypothesis: This has something to do with a maximum health reduction effect being the thing that kills a player that's currently transformed.
