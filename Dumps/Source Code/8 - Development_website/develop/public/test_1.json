Some of it is just wrong, some of it just feels off.  I missed some of it just because I wasn't writing stuff down all the way until just now.  This area in general also uses a LOT of adverbs which is generally something you want to avoid in creative writing, but it's more forgivable during character speech.\r\n\r\nThe Mystery Continues-\r\nWrong: \"the mystery still remains at foot\" - at foot should be afoot.\r\nWrong: \"his time is much more occupied then mine\" - then should be than.\r\n\r\nTinkering Away-\r\nWrong: \"I was renowned engineer\" should be \"I was a renowned engineer.\"\r\nWrong: \"gnomish\" should be \"Gnomish\"\r\nOff/Wrong: \"I always put my own twists on them for extra sturdiness and to be able to handle a dwarf!\"  I think this is meant to say his inventions are fit for a Dwarf, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nZabini's Information-\r\nWrong: \"It's presence\" should be Its.\r\nWrong: \"Or at the very least has only cropped up at the last few weeks at a level where many like myself, and Marge would have come to notice it.\" is a sentence fragment.  Belongs attached to previous sentence, and there shouldn't be a comma after myself.  You could just do a dash or nothing to connect it to the last paragraph.\r\nWrong: \"or perhaps something, or someone,\" or someone should be separated by hyphens or parentheses, though usually it's hyphens.\r\nWrong: \"I wish you luck in finding what is causing the tainting darkness,\" Slightly odd phrasing, but the important thing here is the following statement is only loosely associated with this one, so it should be separated by either a semicolon or a period.  A semicolon is what your college professor would give you points for here though.\r\nWrong: \"re-live\" should be relive.\r\n\r\nZabini's Information (on completion)-\r\nWrong: \"Hmm..\" An ellipsis explicitly has 3 periods.  \r\nOff: \"So he believes that perhaps this source\" is wordy.  I'd take another swing at it.  It takes too long to reach the goal.\r\n\r\nA Potential Clue-\r\nWrong: \"So, Zabini may be on to something actually,\" Use onto in all circumstances unless on is part of the verb.  Here be is the verb, so onto shows his ability to understand.  Also, don't end this phrase with a comma, end it with a period and start the next sentence fresh.\r\nWrong: \"in all my research I have been unable to locate the source of this magic,\" End this with either a period or a semicolon, same explanation as before.\r\nWrong: \"But,\" remove the comma.  Also, later in this sentence, he is somewhat unclear.  Consider replacing it with a proper noun, or rearranging the last paragraph to bring Zabini closer to \"he\"\r\nWrong: \"coming's and going's\" Remove the apostrophes.  They are neither short for nor possess anything.\r\nOff: \"look to them as a potential source of this darkness, or at the very least, investigate it\" Kinda repeating herself here, also remove the comma after least, also rephrase it to them (or something more clear).\r\n\r\nLord Commander Ryke (outside of quest)-\r\nWrong: \"comin.\"  Either put a g or an apostrophe after comin. Both times.\r\n\r\nA Potential Clue (on completion)-\r\nWrong: \"Interesting report,\" change the comma to a period.\r\nOff: \"let me check my records and make sure about the new people within the town.\" Phrased weird.  Make sure what?  Make sure he knows them?  Make sure he knows where they are?  Could be more clear.\r\n\r\nOverlapping Investigations-\r\nWrong: Probably include a period at the end of the first sentence.  I get it's him emoting but still.\r\nWrong: \"So, it seems\" Remove the comma.\r\nOff: \"into town, though he hails from the...\" The statement following \"into town,\" isn't contradicting the last one.  Understandable but still odd phrasing.  Could be cleaner.\r\nWrong: \"Stormwind, Harlus Ashbuckle\" Replace the comma with a hyphen.\r\nOff: \"out of my jurisdiction to press\" Press charges?  What?  Unsure what he means here.\r\nWrong: \"being that this individual has... Complications.\"  An ellipsis does not ALWAYS end a sentence.  Complications should not be capitalized here.\r\nWrong: \"by the SI:7, I only\" either use a period or a semicolon here, not a comma, but probably a period because of how long the next chunk is.\r\nOff: \"Meet up with him\" is unclear.  The last him was referring to the guy I'm trying to dig up dirt on, not the SI:7 operative.  Use a proper noun here.  Also end this chunk with a period.\r\nWrong: \"Dursley, he can\" put an and here, and you can probably drop the extra he to avoid using it so much in close proximity.\r\nWrong: (on completion) \"understand, playername?\" Drop the comma.\r\n\r\nRobb's Report-\r\nOff: \"If Lord Commander Ryke's suspicions be true,\" is he a pirate?\r\nWrong: \"would be breaking vow he has sworn\" \"breaking vow\" should be \"breaking the vow\"\r\nOff: \"to nobility within Stormwind\" I know what's being said but it could be a lot more clear.  Probbaly something like \"to the nobility of Stormwind\" or something like that.\r\nWAY off: \"Of course, that same nobility having gotten him out of the Stormwind Stockade when the man was wanted for crimes of practicing forbidden magic, and murder both\" Not a sentence at all.  I'll try to rephrase it here: \"Of course, that's the same nobility that got him out of the Stockades despite his crimes including the practice of forbidden magic and murder.\"  Something like that.  You can just straight rip my sentence if you want, I don't care.\r\nOff: \"As much as I have my dislike for the House of Nobles I do what I am told.\"  Unclear, buried the action of the sentence, try something like, \"Despite my malcontent for the House of Nobles, I do what I am told.\"\r\nOff: \"leader of the SI:7 within Stormwind in Old Town\" most people would probably just say something to the effect of \"leader of the SI:7 within the Stormwind Old Town\" or \"leader of the SI:7 within Old Stormwind\" or something like that.\r\nWrong: \"Keep them sealed,\" use a semicolon instead of a comma.\r\nOff: \"don't show yourself to him, or myself again.\" use hyphens to set off \"or myself\", also be more clear who him is.  Shaw?  Genuinely uncertain but that's my best guess.\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm being sent off to Stormwind so I'll make a new post for when I get there.  This is already a lot.","updatedAt":"2022-01-10T22:18:55+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-01-10T22:18:55+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"palimoschnitzel"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-12-28T12:56:06+0100","number":595,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"A boat on minimap in SW Harbor, but no boat in-game","body":"![Untitle1d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93767462/147563901-3bf662b1-b7d2-4666-b560-7eaf89df739a.png)\r\n","updatedAt":"2022-01-10T12:59:48+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-01-10T12:59:48+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"palimoschnitzel"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-12-28T12:50:10+0100","number":594,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"When I move cursor over SW harbor, \"Westfall\" label appears.","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93767462/147563407-0e429cff-2d28-48ba-868d-f3b011d71d59.png)\r\n\r\nI know it's because there were no Harbor in Vanilla, but maybe it can be fixed.","updatedAt":"2022-01-10T13:00:03+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-01-10T13:00:03+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"palimoschnitzel"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-12-28T12:48:30+0100","number":593,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"NPCs in Stormwind Harbor are frozen.","body":"They are literally frozen.

(The entire game was 3 Horde v. 1 Alliance.)\r\n\r\n I have had this happen dozens of times where Alliance outnumbered Horde but never when Horde outnumbered Alliance.\r\n\r\nWhat normally happens is Alliance run all over Horde and get 2 quick caps and the games ends when the 5 minute timer runs down with a score of 2-0 and the game recording 'Alliance wins'.   This is only what I 'remember' happening.  I don't have screenshots because it seemed to be the proper outcome and didn't strike me as odd.  Moreover I could be misremembering something.  It is possible the alliance players actually got 3 caps in the 5 minutes and I was just screwing around mid-field, pvping with some random dude and didn't notice.  Again this seemed to be the proper outcome.  In this, much more common scenario, both sides get 3 (alliance, the winners) marks and 1(horde, the losers) mark.  \r\n\r\nHowever when this 'black swan event' of Horde outnumbering Alliance in Warsong gulch happened, the game ended when the 5 minute timer ran out, and no marks were awarded.  The score was 0-2.  The 3rd flag was captured and being ran down the field by Horde, in a mirror to what typically happens in an Alliance heavy game when the game ended.  No marks were awarded.  I'm unsure if bonus honor was awarded as I had not noted what my 'this week' honor was before and after the battleground.  I had 13 marks of honor in my bank so it couldn't be a full stack issue.  I checked my mailbox an hour later and nothing.  No marks were in my backpack.\r\n\r\nI can't remember who the other 2 hordes were but Mikiman was the only alliance player in the bg.  Again I could be misremembering how it works out or conflating multiple things happening.  But the real problem is it adds to an impression of Alliance favoritism.  Even if it turns out to be an incorrect remembering of events on my part, a clear policy of what 'should' happen might be useful.  When asking about the underlying rules for when/how marks get handed out during incomplete games several people from /world messaged me saying 'this is just intended behavior' with each having a different idea of which portion of the behavior was responsible.\r\n\r\nEven if 'alliance wins by default' is true it should be easier to find in some FAQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Have a 3 Alliance v. 1 Horde Warsong gultch game and have the 3 Alliance get 2 'flag captures' within the 5 minute time frame.  See who gets what marks.\r\n2.

But some time recently I have encountered a problem where I can no longer enable or disable any addon. That includes both the character menu and in-game pfUI menu window.\r\n \r\n**Problem 1: All the addons that I had enabled before this problem occurred I can now only enable or disable by moving the folders in and out of \"AddOns\" folder when my game is closed and then launch the game.**\r\n\r\n**Problem 2: All the addons that I had disabled before the problem occurred I can no longer enable in any way. I tried doing the same thing that I do in Problem 1 case but they still appear disabled when I launch the game again.** \r\n\r\nI don┬┤t think that this is either an outdated addon problem or a pfUI problem because:\r\n\r\n- I╦Öm using the current version of every addon that I have and I even decided to test what happens when I only have one or two addons in my \"AddOns\" folder (I chose the most recent updated ones). \r\n\r\n- In some cases I removed pfUI from \"AddOns\" and I tested the situation with default Blizz UI. \r\n\r\n- And then finally, I even tested it by having LFT as the only addon in the game (cause that┬┤s the only addon that I had when I logged in to the client for the very first time). \r\n\r\nBasically, in every single one of these situations, the problem is still there.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n\r\n![turtlewow1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94743820/142728249-ee5b5c73-5eb5-4e3a-b51f-abf52543bb49.jpg)\r\n\r\n![turtlewow2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94743820/142728250-0a5d9ef7-9a96-4840-bbda-0aa69dd5f00b.png)\r\n\r\nThese are the screenshots of both character menu and in-game settings.

And then this problem occurred and now I can no longer enable it (I even tried downloading it again but that didn┬┤t work either).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

Go to \"Addons\" in the bottom left, check or uncheck and then log back in.\r\n\r\nWith in-game pfUI menu window you will get a message that UI needs to reload after checking or unchecking and after the reload the changes are supposed to occur.

It should, as Vengeance trigger on any critical success, from spells, abilities, melee attacks alike.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Get a paladin with Storm Gauntlets and Vengeance\r\n2. Attack a mob and crit with the Gauntlets' proc\r\n-> The proc works (3 damage on each melee strike and melee judgement)\r\n-> It correctly crits (with %spellcrit)\r\n-> It doesn't scale with spell power (normal)\r\nBut : 3. Its crit doesn't proc Vengeance.\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nThe item : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=12632\r\nThe talent : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=20059\r\nThe spells triggered by the item : \r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=16615\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=16614\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\n\r\nStorm Gauntlets should activate Vengeance. Indeed: its proc activates a spell, and when a spell crits, Vengeance activates.\r\nIt worked like that during vanilla, and during classic ; it is a known, important and old quirk of retribution paladin itemization.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTE : \r\nThe same behaviour should be observed on other items with the same kind of effect. It is for example known : \r\n- Fiery Plate Gauntlet https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=12631\r\n- Blazefury Medallion https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=17111\r\nshould also trigger Vengeance. \r\n\r\nI did not try those effects yet. I don't know if the bug is specific to Storm Gauntlets or to all this family of effects on Turtle WoW. Perhaps it should be investigated.","updatedAt":"2022-04-29T23:57:47+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-04-29T23:57:46+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"jameyboor"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-10-27T20:10:30+0200","number":401,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Quest Freedom for all Creatures","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\n![afbeelding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1365563/139122478-013e93a4-9a76-440d-a040-ef6be9c534d5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.\r\n2. \r\n3. \r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=\r\nItem: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=\r\nQuest: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=\r\nSpell: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=\r\nObject: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?object=\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

Further, non-rp reasons, price uniformity should exist for players.\r\n\r\nWhether Darnassus (\"all druids look to the home tree\") or Stormwind (\"these npcs all are allied to the city / house / king\"), is up to you. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, for even more rp, have each of the trainers have a text dialog where you can speak with them and they, in character, speak about how they are allied with a particular reputation.  So, Theridran \"always looks to the home tree\", another one \"loves the Park, the city, and the new life here in Stormwind\", and another \"remembers his / her time passing through Ironforge... all those years ago... and wishes to return.\"","updatedAt":"2022-02-14T11:22:16+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-02-14T11:22:16+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"AdmiralAwsum"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"GrenderG"},"body":"Hello, do you have any of the required quests? https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=737#objective-of","createdAt":"2021-09-26T14:31:32+0200"},{"author":{"login":"AdmiralAwsum"},"body":"Hi @GrenderG!\r\n\r\nThe item is not a quest item and it could be obtained without having the quests connected to it (at least on retail classic).","createdAt":"2021-09-27T09:43:08+0200"},{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66763404/137510554-ea942a9e-4f5d-4a1a-bce4-2725636343f4.png)\r\n\r\nIt did seem to drop w/o the quest in the earlier patches.

Even with extra talent points in stealth ability (as a rogue or Druid), NPCs can detect you in stealth from too far away.  Additionally, the detection behaviour is not normal. Normally if you go within NPC detection range, they will turn to face you, and make a ΓÇ£huh?ΓÇ¥ alert sound. If you stop moving, they will look in your direction for awhile then turn away, or continue their pathing, and will then only go straight to attack if their resumed path brings them even closer to you.  On this server, if they detect you and your range is too close, they will immediately transition into attack. This should not happen because the whole point of the detection alert is to give you a chance to move away.\r\n\r\nThis is a big problem because it essentially almost makes stealthed skills useless. As a rogue IΓÇÖm finding it very hard to pick pocket any NPC that is not standing completely still, and it makes skills like rogueΓÇÖs ΓÇ£ambushΓÇ¥ almost completely useless.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Go stealth\r\n2. Move towards to NPC\r\n3. NPC will detect you from quite far away.

So for eg, a stealthed player who is level 20, with 5 points into improved stealth talent, should have the stealth detection radius of a level 25 player to the NPC. This should mean that it is almost impossible for an NPC/mob to detect you if they are at equal / lower level than you, unless you cross directly into their path/hit-box.\r\n","updatedAt":"2022-02-23T23:15:03+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-02-23T23:14:55+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Rakura1"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"Rakura1"},"body":"Follow up: It appears it is the same bug with cenarion where the player will be at war with them upon reaching neutral.","createdAt":"2021-09-27T14:37:20+0200"},{"author":{"login":"Nolin7777"},"body":"Thanks, will be fixed at next update","createdAt":"2021-10-02T20:49:02+0200"}],"createdAt":"2021-09-25T15:29:09+0200","number":342,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Can't Talk with Timbermaw despite being neutral","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

It seems as though damage reduction taken is factored into the resistance equation when it should not be, and so blessing of sanctuary is only going to reduce damage taken from spells by 10% of the stated value when it should be by 100%.

A very clear example of blessing of sanctuary working against spells is against ragnaros.

Arcane Missles that \"fixed\" the spell animation matching up with the channel bar the spell has been bugged due to the fact that it can no longer proc anything apart from Arcane Concentration on the cast itself.\r\nTo explain why this is a bug allow me to explain how Arcane Missles used to,and should,work:\r\n                                   Arcane Missles prior to the 14.06.2021 update \"ΓÇó Arcane Missiles animation has been fixed and are now synced with damage hits.\",used to have 6 different shots that would hit an enemy.The first one would be a \"dry shot\",the actual cast itself (that used to put you in combat but was later changed to not do so <3) which could proc Arcane Concentration and was the only part of the spell that could proc the Darkmoon Card:Blue Dragon effect.Following this \"dry shot\" was the actual 5 missles,the last of which would often times come AFTER the channel finished(hence the \"fix\").In practice though,this meant that the 5th missle would simply take the place of the \"dry shot\" of the next channel,if timed correctly,resulting in a constant stream of missles.Those 5 missles would be able to proc any and all effects that would trigger upon LANDING a spell,including stuff like Arcane Concentration and Blade of Eternal Darkness.It could also proc the tier 2 mage set bonus for the full set on each missle,despite it triggering upon \"casting Arcane Missles\".\r\n                                  So in summery:Arcane Missles counted as 5 different spells united under one channel,for the purpose of procs that deal with casting and landing spells(this includes critical hits,misses and resists) but it is still only considered 1 \"succesfull spell\"(for the purpose of the Blue Card) because I assume that is tied to the spending mana(which you pay the full ammount upon cast.You don't get a refund of mana if you only channel for 2 missles).\r\n\r\n--\"But that's how it's on classic\"--\r\n\r\nWhile the devs for Classic WoW did an amazing job shaping the modern wow client into what we now know as Classic WoW,the truth of the matter is that it is just a butchered version of the modern client.\r\nIn Retail,Arcane Missles is a machinegun that is affected by cast speed alterations and the only part of the actual spell that can proc anything(including critical hits) is the cast itself.This sadly has translated into Classic WoW with the result being this broken version of Arcane Missles that we sadly now have on our server.\r\n\r\nI must stress that each missle CAN still critically hit,miss and get resisted INDEPENDENTLY.Not only that,but each missle CAN still proc the Wrath of Cenarius ring effect.And if each missle is still considered a different instance of spell HIT,it should still proc the effects that it used to be able to.\r\n\r\nhttps://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12577/arcane-concentration#modifies \r\n\r\n/\\ (Clearly states \"after any damage spell hits a target\",NOT \"upon a succesfull spellcast\")\r\n\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=21190\r\n\r\n/\\(It can still proc this item on each missle) (Though to be fair,this thing can proc on wand hits so hey)\r\n\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=17780\r\n\r\n/\\(Cannot proc this anymore,at all)\r\n\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=22007\r\n\r\n/\\(Confirmed to not be able to proc it anymore despite being able to before the update)\r\n\r\nhttps://classic.wowhead.com/item=19288/darkmoon-card-blue-dragon\r\n\r\n/\\(Only procs on the cast itself,unchanged)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAll I'm asking is to simply revert whatever changes were made with the 14/06/2021 update \"ΓÇó Arcane Missiles animation has been fixed and are now synced with damage hits.\" and simply leave it as it used to be, \"bugged animation\" and everything.It worked fine,it was fun to play with and Classic is simply wrong on this one.\r\n\r\npls help <3\r\n\r\n\r\n
