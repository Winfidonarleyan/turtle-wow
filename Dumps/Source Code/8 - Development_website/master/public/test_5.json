Some probabilistic maths suggest that something is odd with the loot table. \r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n\r\nDrop chance (probability of success) from each boss: 7% or 0.07\r\nNumber of attempts for each boss: 28 (each week since February)\r\nThe formula to calculate the probability of at least one success from multiple independent events remains the same:\r\n\r\nProbability of getting the item from at least one boss = 1 - (1 - p)^n\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n\r\np is the probability of success in a single attempt (drop rate from one boss).\r\nn is the number of attempts.\r\nFor this case, p is 0.07 (drop rate from one boss), and n is 28 (number of attempts for each boss).\r\n\r\nSince there are three bosses, we need to apply this formula for each boss and then take into account that getting the item from any one of the bosses is sufficient:\r\n\r\nProbability of getting the item from at least one boss =\r\n1 - (1 - p)^n * (1 - p)^n * (1 - p)^n\r\n1 - (1 - p)^3n\r\n\r\nSubstituting the values:\r\nProbability = 1 - (1 - 0.07)^(3 * 28) Γëê 0.99999999913\r\n\r\nSo, the probability that the item would drop at least once during these 28 attempts from any of the three bosses with a 7% drop chance is approximately 0.99999999913, or about 99.999999913%.\r\n\r\n**Yet nothing dropped for 28 weeks now**\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

Use api to see their attack power. You'll see they have 1 less attackpower than they should (unplayable). So far all is fine. Now apply curse of reck. Suddenly demo shout's effect is **gone**. The debuff is still on the enemy, but now the enemy's ap is equal to base ap+90. You try to reapply demo shout but to no success, as long as the demo shout debuff is still on the mob, you can't reduce his ap. You need to wait until demo shout naturally falls off, and hope that nobody refreshes it because that prolongs the time the bug is happening.\r\nAfter it falls off, the mob has only one debuff (curse of reck) and has the correct AP for that. Now you use demo shout, and this time curse of reck's effect is gone, while the debuff persists on the enemy.\r\n\r\nI didn't test with screech or demo roar, but I'm certain they'll be bugged in the same way.\r\n\r\nTo emphasize what I said before, this is not merely a visual bug. Mob attack power is REALLY behaving this wonky way behind the stage. Their swing damage is affected by this bug. If you use demo shout and then use curse of recklessness. The enemy will do 20% more damage than it should for the whole duration that demo shout is up.\r\n\r\nFull recording of the above steps\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkVbFY7Uxi4\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\ntoo many to list.

It did proc for me but very rarely, I am not actually so sure that those procs ever reached 3% proc chance, so maybe some other effect is interfering with that chance being checked in the first place. As in, a check has to pass - or fail - and in one of these outcomes the code goes and checks for the next 'when struck' effect in the stack, but not in the other case. So if this is the case, it would mean that the realized proc chance could be way lower than 3%. My truesilver bplate had a lesser absorbtion enchantment (5% chance on when struck to get 25 pts of absorb shield and that enchantment procced in almost every encounter, the heal in maybe one in twenty)\r\n\r\nAnyways, 3% proc chance is, in layman terms, 3 hits out of 100 or 1 hit out of 33 (you can easily get hit over 33 times in a battle engagement if you are a low dps but high survivability pally, and that's like a bell curve chance of it happening, as it might happen multiple times or none at all, too). And by hit, specifically hits that don't miss, don't get parried, dodged - not sure if shield block either partially or by fully negating the hit prevents the check from going through. This might be the number one culprit to look at, since prot paladins tend to have a lot of shield block chance with redoubt and holy shield having decent uptime when aoe farming. The first point of 'confusion' is to actually figure out if the hit has to deal at least 1 point of hitpoint damage in order for the effect to be rolled for.\r\n\r\nSo basically, you might have shadow objects stacked over the player object with all having the function with the same name (query_when_struck(), for example), and the one on top - last one to shadow the shadowed player object - (checked first) returns 1 or 0 or something else instead of 'return shadowed_object()->query_when_struck() which would make the check go through to the next object and its query_when_struck() function when an effect happens or does not happen. This combobreaks the multiple query_when_struck() effects that should normally/logically get all checked, in order, one at a time. The query_when_struck() functions below this first return of 'something else but what is needed for the roll to continue' don't get checked properly.\r\n\r\nBut I've never looked under the bonnet of the private server WoW, so I'm basically just relying on my past experience with an LPC multi-user dungeon and how it would handle a case like this.","createdAt":"2023-08-13T05:39:54+0200"},{"author":{"login":"SuqMadiqM8"},"body":"Thanks for you insight on the matter.

The amount of backhand cc's a lvl 60 pally gets in Stockade aoe farming is multiple times higher to how it went on SoM. Like, drastically different by an order of magnitude, and on here I have 5% resistance from holy talent whereas on SoM I didn't. On SoM even that minuscule amount of cc's was further reduced by equipping a trinket with 1% resistance against stuns (The one you get from killing Araj in WPL), leading me to believe that it is something lik 3% - 1% = 2%, so even the 1% effect was in actuality a 33% reduction in that scenario, so a 5% effect from talent should basically force it down to a 1% chance. But it does not do that on twow.\r\n\r\nSo, is free action potion in essence a 100% resistance bonus vs stun-like effects as far as the code is concerned, and that resistance bonus would only apply in a resistance check, which some cc attacks don't actually give the player, instead relying on a combat accuracy check instead?","createdAt":"2023-08-13T05:56:08+0200"},{"author":{"login":"balakethelock"},"body":"Short story actually short, these gorillas use an ability made by blizzard to be used by Lieutenant General Andorov.

Unfortunately, this blanket increase has affected certain locations more than otheres. Mainly, caves. In particular, the naga cave in Darkshore, where you have a quest to pick mushrooms. I tried soloing the quest as a lvl 16 druid. I stepped one foot into the cave, got attacked by two melee nagas. I killed them, healed up, attacked the next naga - a caster. The moment I killed the caster, the two naga melees had already respawned and attacked me. The moment I re-killed those two, the caster had respawned and attacks me. I kill the caster, the two naga melees already respawn and attack me. I flee the cave, with 5 hostile nagas chasing me. This respawn speed hike makes it a mission improbable to do that mushroom quest.

Disregard critical strikes for all the upcoming tests, only consider regular non critical damage. On a priest, have a wand equipped and any rank of Inner Fire(results are much easier to see on a low damage low level wand because the difference in damage would be huge and VERY noticeable). \r\n1. Check the base damage of your wand in the stat sheet, as well as on a training dummy.\r\n2. Buff yourself with Inner Fire, check that the wand's damage in the character sheet didn't change compared to test 1. Check the real damage on training dummies and acknowledge that the Attack Power buff from Inner Fire indeed did NOT change the wand's damage at all compared to the damage of the test 1.\r\n3. Remove the Inner Fire buff. Get the Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer buff. Check in the character sheet that the wand's damage has been increased when compared to tests 1 and 2.

Describe how it should work:**\r\nSo far, it looks like the Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer's 140 Attack Power buff boosts wand's damage, while other regular Attack Power or Ranged Attack Power do not buff wand's damage at all. For the sake of consistency, the attack power granted by the Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer should either not buff wand's damage, or all the other sources of Attack Power and Ranged Attack Power should buff wand's damage. \r\nIf i were to suggest one of the 2 outcomes, i'd rather all sources of Ranged Attack Power (including but not limited to the Ranged Attack Power granted by the agility stat) and regular Attack Power actually buff all wand's damage, that way this stat would have at least some (if limited) use to casters and could be played around with some more exotic / hybrid itemization choices (after all, the Inner Fire's extra Attack Power was kind of supposed to lean that way already).\r\n","updatedAt":"2023-12-29T06:34:02+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-12-29T06:33:41+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"dh-orko"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-07-27T21:32:19+0200","number":4042,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"turtlewow-bug-tracker","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.\r\n2. \r\n3. \r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=\r\nItem: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=\r\nQuest: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=\r\nSpell: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=\r\nObject: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?object=\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

So, in total the abuser will get free 18000 healing in one minute.

This is cast every couple seconds instead of the intended every fifteen-thirty seconds after the pull begins and should only deal a couple hundred damage instead of the current couple thousand. The reason these abilities are intended as doing so little damage is because, when combined with the Nullifiers they are with, it can wipe the debuffed raid immediately.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Anubisath Warder should, instead of having all three of these buffs, choose between any two of Dust Cloud, Fear, and Silence, and cast them less frequently (also about every fifteen-thirty seconds, and not at the same time).\r\n\r\nI have timestamped proof of how the Anubisath Warder should be below, showcasing their tighter pick of abilities and heavily nerfed Fire Nova.\r\n\r\nVOD 1:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-tNMCO7_LiY?t=4653\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-tNMCO7_LiY?t=4727\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-tNMCO7_LiY?t=5024\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-tNMCO7_LiY?t=5361\r\nVOD 2:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/0MnMauoKYh8?t=2187\r\nhttps://youtu.be/0MnMauoKYh8?t=2449\r\nhttps://youtu.be/0MnMauoKYh8?t=2485\r\n\r\nWhat with Shard of the Fallen Star being given PVE stats, these mobs being impossible to kill presents an unnecessary hurdle that encourages skipping trash.

Hit ~90 damage to plate mail (4857 AC, 53% mitigation against lvl 46 enemies), but the fireball they chaincast only lands for 92 damage non-resisted. I can't remember the exact power of official server scarlet diviner fireball, but I'd expect it to be at least 150 damage, maybe even 180.\r\n\r\nFireball : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=9053\r\nMana burn : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=8131\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nScarlet monk\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=4540\r\n\r\nDoesn't interrupt spells being cast like they should with their kick, or was it pummel on official servers... Tested with two 3 second holy lights (no pushback resistance), first one vs one monk, the 2nd one vs two monks. So the actual casting time was longer due to being constantly hit in the melee. On official, their AI forces them to use their interrupt when they detect someone casting in melee range, even if it's not their current target (but is still in their frontal sector). I only ever saw their thrash give them one extra hit, but I keenly remember them hitting 3 hit bursts on official. Maybe one attack failed to land and didn't show up every single time they thrashed, hard to say.\r\n\r\nKick : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=11978\r\nThrash : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=3417\r\n\r\nAlso, they don't hit hard enough, their dps on TurtleWoW seems to be around the same as other elites in the dungeon, even though they were notorious for hitting hard on official SM lib.\r\n\r\n---\r\nScarlet gallant\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=4287\r\n\r\nCrusader strike they use is the TurtleWoW version, that does almost no damage and might actually be entirely physical damage instead of holy, so the holy debuff they apply does actually next to nothing, since only scarlet adepts(?) in the dungeon can actually deal holy damage. I recall that they should hit for around 30-40 holy damage per stack of the applied debuff, so with full stacks, you should see damages as high as 140-170 ish. Also, if the strike is physical, then armour protects against it and it might be shield blockable(?), whereas a holy damage would not be protected by armour or shield block afaik. \r\n\r\nCrusader strike : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=14517\r\n\r\n---\r\nScarlet chaplain\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=4299\r\n\r\nSeems to be by far the most dangerous enemy in SM lib as it currently stands, with the exception of boss fights. Hits hard in melee, shields, applies HoT. If I had to suggest a bug in this npc, it would be that they hit harder than they should if they are a support unit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\nDid above, in an itemized list sort of way. Hopefully it should be readable.\r\nLook into the melee damage per swing numbers first and foremost. Fix broken AI with regards to abilities that don't get used. Fix interrupts being used properly, even against secondary targets. Give scarlet gallants their old crusader strike back, the one that deals 100% holy damage and a decent chunk of damage that benefits from the holy damage vulnerability debuff they apply.\r\n\r\nAlso, the patrols didn't spawn in the first courtyard as the party progressed deeper into the dungeon. There should be some patrols there usually by the time they kill the final boss. At least monks. I can't remember the exact numbers and groupings, but it's usually dangerous enough to kill player characters if they try to run outside by themselves without stealth if they didn't hearth out.","updatedAt":"2023-12-29T10:24:38+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"patrycos"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"patrycos"},"body":"PS.

In the clearest versions of the docs, it all suggests that if my character dies, he loses 5% of the experience that has been accumulated towards the next level, such that if he is very close to the next level, he would lose much more experience than if he were to die very shortly after leveling up.\r\n\r\nHowever, when looking at the numbers that change after my character dies, he actually loses an amount of accumulated experience equal to 5% of the **total** amount of experience required to reach the next level, regardless of how far into the next level he is (well, I assume that it would drop down to 0 if he were to die in that range, but you get the idea... I don't really want to test this part :sweat_smile:).\r\n\r\nFrom https://turtle-wow.org/#/slow-and-steady:\r\n> If you die, you lose 5% of your current level experience\r\n\r\nFrom the glyph item at the glyph master:\r\n> You lose 5% of your experience on death\r\n\r\nOn the tooltip in my spellbook:\r\n> Lose 5% of accumulated experience from current level upon being defeated by enemies\r\n\r\nTo me, especially the last one of those makes it sound unambiguously like I should expect that if my character dies with 100 experience towards the next level, then he should lose 5 points of experience, regardless of what level he is.  For the other two, I guess it can **maybe** be construed as ambiguous, now that I revisit it after seeing how it actually works, but I didn't detect any hints of ambiguity when reading them the first time: it seemed pretty straightforward that I should lose 5% of something that I have, not 5% of something that I don't have.\r\n\r\nThis ultimately isn't a dealbreaker for me, and I would have picked up the challenge either way (though I would have been quite a bit more careful if I had known), but I would have appreciated more consistent documentation.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. At level 40, die with something like 30000 experience points towards the next level (total experience points required to reach 41: 90700).  Not extremely close to 0, not extremely close to the next level.\r\n2. Observe the chat message that reports how much experience you have lost.\r\n3.

Describe how it should work:**\r\n\r\nAs documented, I would expect to lose something less than 4535 points of experience (90700 * 0.05 = 4535), based on my actual progression towards the next level.\r\n\r\nBut I would also be perfectly happy (as far as this report is concerned, at least) if the documentation were just updated to be more consistent with what actually happens.  Some ideas I've had:\r\n- If you die, you lose 5% of your current level's total experience\r\n- You lose 5% of your level's total experience on death\r\n- Upon being defeated by enemies, lose accumulated experience from current level equal to 5% of the needed total","updatedAt":"2023-12-08T05:02:49+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Seidaken"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"GitGurky"},"body":"https://web.archive.org/web/20060613220942/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/mob.html?wmob=2780\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20060613220942/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/mob.html?wmob=2781\r\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20060515045242/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/mob.html?wmob=2782\r\n\r\nIf you check your links again you can see the wowhead numbers change.

The player needs to place their Unforged Seal of Ascension on the ground, MC Emberstrife, and then use his flamebreath skill to \"forge\" the seal.  The player then needs to click on the \"Forged Seal of Ascension\" to loot the quest item needed to complete the quest.  HOWEVER, the other person on this quest also in my group looted this \"Forged Seal of Ascension\", which caused my Unforged Seal of Ascension & Orb of Draconic Energy to disappear.  He still had his unforged seal + orb so we waited 15minutes for Emberstrife to respawn.  However, when we attempted this again, the unforged seal simply disappeared when Emberstrife breathed on it.  So now I am left without the unforged seal or orb, and I have no way of completing the quest.\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Have multiple members with Seal of Ascension quest killing Emberstrife\r\n2. Have Emberstrife breath on the unforged seal to make it a forged seal\r\n3.

Then fire nova is there to pulse every so often to wipe the raid in case the Nullifiers succeed. Because when Nullifiers reach full mana they put the entire raid at 1 hp and stun it, making it impossible to live through a fire nova or mass root (which does damage). They're not supposed to spam fire nova so often that they're more dangerous than the pre-Twins single Anubisath miniboss pulls.","createdAt":"2023-06-30T22:11:25+0200"},{"author":{"login":"GitGurky"},"body":"https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/3969","createdAt":"2023-07-18T16:29:12+0200"},{"author":{"login":"balakethelock"},"body":"Written guide sources all say these mobs use abilities in sets, like the Anubisath Defenders before them. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JpnxI9cYFzsCRoiiwgvz5YmQesovAf0q0wuvY8QEy4k/edit\r\nThere is evidence arguing for both sides, but to be honest it's impossible to tell unless you go to classic and stay in combat with the mob for 10 minutes tracking its abilities.\r\n\r\nThe timers from classic sniffs are very variable, they seem to point towards:\r\nFire nova every 15-20 secs\r\nCC ability (entangling roots/fear) every 15-20 secs\r\nNullifying ability (dust/silence) every 10-30 secs\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- Fixing Anubisath Warder ability timers\r\nDELETE FROM `creature_ai_events` WHERE `creature_id`=15311;\r\nINSERT INTO `creature_ai_events` (`id`, `creature_id`, `condition_id`, `event_type`, `event_inverse_phase_mask`, `event_chance`, `event_flags`, `event_param1`, `event_param2`, `event_param3`, `event_param4`, `action1_script`, `action2_script`, `action3_script`, `comment`) VALUES (1531101, 15311, 0, 0, 0, 100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1531101, 0, 0, 'Anubisath Warder -

The wasps have the ability to apply a debuff called Itch, which turns into Vekniss Catalyst (poison debuff) as well as apply Vekniss Catalyst directly when out of range of their target. Vekniss Catalyst allows the Stingers within each pack to charge players afflicted with the debuff for 6000 damage. In Turtle WoW, it seems that Vekniss Wasps both apply Itch rarely as well as they don't apply Catalyst when out of range at the pull. In Blizzard Classic, three wasps could apply 6-10 Itch debuffs within the first seven seconds of combat, as well as inflicting Vekniss Catalyst directly on the initial targets out of range. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Vekniss Stingers are supposed to cast their charges regardless of players being poisoned or not. They have a charge ability primer, and then they charge a player with either 1k damage if they're unpoisoned, or 6k if they're poisoned. Instead, they sit around doing nothing and are cleave/AoE fodder. As it is, I've never seen a Vekniss Stinger use its charge in almost a year of AQ40 on Turtle WoW.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Engage in combat with a stinger pack, note that they don't cast catalyst directly when out of range.\r\n2.

All mobs have some base strength dependent on their level.\r\n\r\nVmangos fixed this by adopting blizzlike CreatureLevelStats system. In turtle wow, mobs don't have any base stats, and even if they gain some they don't benefit from them at all.\r\n\r\nThe positive stat increases are easy, but effects that reduce enemy strength might be a bit of a hurdle.\r\nI suppose one way to implement this without redoing the whole creature database, is allow mobs to have negative strength values.

Pull twin emps trash with 10+ people\r\n2. See the person pulling get oneshot\r\n3. See multiple MCs go off right away\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\nThese mobs are meant to use their abilities not at the same time, and the MCs are meant to be rare. Plentiful footage from Classic exists that shows this trash isn't meant to be too hard.\r\n\r\nThe ideal play should be for guilds to pull these trash and quickly get through them, and the invisibility skip method should be a much slower, last resort trick. With this fixed, this will effectively add content to Turtle WoW, as right now this stretch of content is 100% dead, and not in a good way.","updatedAt":"2023-06-12T02:47:29+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-06-12T02:47:29+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"geojak"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-06-05T22:19:05+0200","number":3632,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"sw captian of guard shell coin script borken","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\nmelris malagard is the captain of the sw guard and sit at hhe trade square \r\nhe somes times says a line\r\n\"cover for me gotta o invest wages at the sell coin office\"\r\nthen he walks to dwarf district in the old office\r\nwhen he arrives there he alines in the (now not there anmore) queue and despawns after a second\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

This ability could be improved with \"Improved Slice and Dice talent\". But if we check the Improved Slice and Dice description we will find that there is no info about Flourish impact. To be honest I started playing rogue in Turtle about one year ago and I just recently incidentally found out about Flourish improvement from \"Improved Slice and Dice\" talent. I guess we need to change the description and as minimum just leave note about Flourish and as maximum - also rename whole talent, like \"Improved Dexterity - Increases the duration of your Slice and Dice and Flourish abilities by 45%.\r\n2) In the previous big patch rogues got a new \"Agitating Poison\" https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=65032. Assassin tree has talent to improve poison effects \"Vile Poisons\" which does not impact threat value. To prevent confusion I suggest add some note, like, \"Does not impact threat generation.\"\r\n3) In TW \"Deadly Poison V\" https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=20844 has the unique ability (in comparison to original vanilla)  to apply different stacks for each weapon. This is a good addition and should be described in poison description to let people know about it.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n1) Check description \"Improved Slice and Dice\" talent description, there is nothing about Flourish. Invest 3 points in Improved Slice and Dice and inspect you extended Flourish duration for 45%\r\n2) it's impossible to check it from the client side, all I have is comments from TW developers, that it has only impact on Agitating Poison poison damage and not any impact on hidden poison threat numbers.\r\n3) Apply Deadly Poison V on both weapons and check that target has 2 Deadly Poison debuffs\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

The reason for this is the [vanilla kill video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REmX3uRTFkQ) the timers were sourced from is sped up. The true timers, which I've calculated from the same video (by counting ticking down of the player's auras, rather than seconds passing in the video) are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSb64kAWeglNJ0S-0dgQ-UKXks8BZ0x8ScpBYjNyWrjmYnxsnvFLMjT94CGTm5_XVPCLihnIZvN4CJw/pubhtml) and they match the timers easily seen in modern classic kill videos, in modern classic's [DBM](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic/blob/1c90828cdc073d74159e3555f8d479ab1753a29e/DBM-AQ40/Ouro.lua#L33) and even in a very old version of BigWigs written way back in 2006 which I found [here scrolling down](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ByAxutR4jmqfVFA4cGNkRG5ZdDQ?resourcekey=0-hw8C-4H6sqH7o22Az-JugQ)\r\n\r\n- Sweep timer from start of cast to next start of cast is exactly 20500 milliseconds every time. If Ouro is casting Sandblast when the timer hits 0, he will start casting sweep immediately after Sandblast cast is over.\r\n\r\n- Sand blast timer is a random value between 20000 ms and 25000 ms. If Ouro is casting Sweep when the timer hits 0, he will start casting sandblast immediately after Sweep cast is over.\r\n\r\n- The first sand blast and the first sweep are not on a special timer, They use the same 20500 timer in the case of sweep and 20000-25000 in the case of sandblast. This means that SANDBLAST_TIMER_INITIAL_MIN and SANDBLAST_TIMER_INITIAL_MAX can effectively be deleted in favor of simply writing the following: (assuming TWow is up to date with VMangos core)\r\n`                    m_uiSweepTimer = SWEEP_TIMER;`\r\n`                    m_uiSandBlastTimer = urand(SandBlastTimerMin(), SandBlastTimerMax());`\r\n\r\nSWEEP_TIMER being 20500\r\nSandBlastTimerMin() being 20000\r\nSandBlastTimerMax() being 25000\r\n\r\n- [ ] The behavior of target selection and threat is deeply flawed. Ouro in Blizzard's implementation is as such: (the following is how it's supposed to work)\r\n- The mob is permanently rooted in place, and has the behavior of a typical rooted mob. He will target and start attacking the highest threat in melee range. If there is nothing to target in melee range, target the highest threat outside it.\r\n\r\n- When Ouro detects that he is targeting somebody outside, he will start a 3 second countdown to submerge. The countdown is stopped the moment someone steps into melee range, taking the attention of Ouro away from the ranged player. (There is already a grace period of 10 seconds from the pull, this is blizzlike behavior and doesn't need to be changed.)\r\n\r\n- When Ouro sweeps, its current target will be knocked away but keeping **all** their threat. It seems that the way it's implemented on VMangos and by extension Turtle Wow stems from bad wording by [Ouro's wiki page](https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Ouro?oldid=388319#:~:text=Sweep%3A%201k%2D2.5k,be%20full%20health.)\r\n> Keep in mind, usually after a sweep, a tank will lose aggro and a new tank will be on Ouro's aggro list. It is crucial that the tank who was swept not go in melee range, as Ouro will return to that warrior, and chances are that warrior will not be full health.\r\n\r\nTo rephrase this in the most specific terms, the tank will lose \"**aggro**\" meaning that Ouro will not try to attack it anymore, obviously because it is out of range. It will not lose it's **threat** , and that is evidenced by Ouro swapping back to it the moment it re-enters melee range)\r\n\r\n- Ouro will then attack the player with the highest threat within melee range. He will NOT give the threat of the previous target to the next one. If the tank who got sweeped away charges back in, Ouro will swap back to him. In this [video timestamp 0:19](https://youtu.be/qQxKak92Hbg?t=19), the tauren tank on the left is sweeped away by Ouro, then Ouro sandblasts a caster who was highest on raw threat, then a different tauren tank enters melee range on the right. This new tank has very low threat because he was waiting out of range the whole time. The main tank on the left runs back to melee range and Ouro immediately swaps back to him (The rule is: Rooted mobs focus the highest threat player within melee range. The main tank did not lose his threat when he was sweeped, the offtank did not borrow any threat from the main tank.)\r\n\r\nThe takeaway from all this: Ouro's ability timers should be changed (easy fix) and his AI should be rewritten to something else entirely, Blizzard used simple rooted mob behavior with a submerge if there is nobody in range, instead of the clumsy inelegant way it's correctly coded (removing threat then giving that threat to someone else).\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15517\r\n\r\nApologies for not sticking to the bug report template, this one's a bit too multifaceted for that.","updatedAt":"2023-12-07T17:53:04+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Vargkatten"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"This is a blizzard NPC.

This is Github), so let me explain again what the exact problem we are reporting is:\r\n\r\nDouble dipping is not a blizzard bug;  it is unintended consequences of a custom change. When Turtle WoW added Holy Strike a completely custom spell, they didn't anticipate that enemy bosses have an interaction with Holy Strike that makes it do upwards of 10k unresistable holy damage to the paladin's allies.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this post is to draw attention to that oversight in the hopes that they fix it. In our last KT kill, we had 3 rets and we made 2 of them respec to holy because ret paladins in a fight with mind control are a ticking time bomb. If they're not CC'd within one second, they're oneshotting somebody in melee, in a lot of cases that somebody is the tank.\r\n\r\nAnother possible solution, is stop the AI that controls mind controlled players from ever casting Holy Strike.","createdAt":"2023-05-16T22:34:14+0200"},{"author":{"login":"burner1024"},"body":"> There were three people in the discussion and the three people agreed.\r\n\r\nLie.\r\n\r\n> Double dipping is not a blizzard bug; it is unintended consequences of a custom change.\r\nWhen Turtle WoW added Holy Strike a completely custom spell, they didn't anticipate that enemy bosses have an interaction with Holy Strike that makes it do upwards of 10k unresistable holy damage to the paladin's allies.\r\n\r\nFor a completely custom spell, word \"blizzlike\" gets thrown around too much in the linked issue.\r\nYou can't have it both ways. Either there are points of reference that can be used to draw parallels with vanilla, in which case there should be links to support those, or it's so completely custom that all talk about vanilla double dipping and seal of command has 0 relevance.","createdAt":"2023-05-16T23:24:15+0200"},{"author":{"login":"balakethelock"},"body":"https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/3393#issuecomment-1536726182\r\nNot a lie.

You were not in the discussion and you still aren't, you're completely lost.\r\n\r\nBlizzlike = works in a way consistent with the way blizzard would have made it.\r\nSince Ignite has double dipping, this isn't a thing that was completely unknown to blizzard back in 2006. It's simply something that never manifested into a problem in practice until Turtle wow added holy strike and made ret paladins something brought commonly into raids.\r\n\r\nSeal of command has double dipping too, paladins can use judgement or click off the buff immediately before the MC to avoid oneshotting their allies. As for holy strike, there's nothing you can do. Even holy paladins can oneshot their allies with holy strike.\r\n\r\nOnce again, this is a thread about holy strike oneshotting allies when under mind control effects.\r\nYou are not concerned with that, you are concerned about the state of paladins in pvp.

Before the nerf, it was often more efficient to farm gold and buy them from non-raiders on the auction house who were multiboxing e'ko farms, due to the giants being marked as elite and the drop rate of the item itself. This change screws over hunters in particular, as their ONLY option for an attack power consumable exists in Juju Might - Winterfall Firewater gives only melee attack power. Solo farming the giants for e'ko is wildly inefficient, as stated earlier, as the drop rate is so low that you can be there for hours killing giants to get as many e'ko as you need to last a full raid.\r\n\r\nIf the ultimate goal with removing world buffs in raid instances was to reduce the amount of time people spend farming outside of alotted raid times to clear the content, this is among the worst changes that could have been made to the game. What used to be a mostly quick n' nasty farm you did with a couple of your friends has turned into more than likely the majority of your time spent out of raid.
