It is already working correctly.\r\n\r\nHi there, not a Dev or working with the bug-tracker team, just an independant Rogue player.\r\nYou can refresh Slice and Dice whenever you wish, and overwrite your own buffs. If this was changed to what you are suggesting, it would impede rogue gameplay even more.

If this was changed to what you are suggesting, it would impede rogue gameplay even more.\r\n\r\nI do believe you should be able to refresh Slice and Dice whenever you wish. However, the key word here is _refresh_. I don't think the rogue should be prevented from casting Slice and Dice (or Flourish) if the duration that remains on the buff is shorter than the duration which would be gained from casting it. This means you should _always_ be able to use a 5 combo Slice and Dice, since even in the completely hypothetical scenario where you've just cast a 5 combo Slice and Dice, _at least_ one global cooldown has already passed, and the new buff would therefore be longer than what remains of the old one.\r\n\r\nIn their current state, the only thing I have an issue with when using Slice and Dice and Flourish is the fact that they lose duration. I don't mean this to be fixed by having the durations add up (as was presented in your TL;DR). In fact, I don't even mind it that much if the combo points and energy are lost if the rogue fumbles their key presses. **I'd just like for the longest of the two durations to be the one that remains.**\r\n\r\nWhat I am suggesting is not \"Prevent rogues from using Slice and Dice while the buff is in effect\", but rather \"Prevent buff duration being lost\".\r\n\r\nI don't recall how this was in Vanilla, expansions or Classic. This is, however, the first time in a rogue career of over fifteen years that I have paid attention to the existence of this bug/feature. Now, this could be because it is a Turtle-specific bug ΓÇô or it could be that I have only noticed it because the way I am playing currently vastly differs from how I used to play on previous servers, namely tanking as a rogue. With the addition of Flourish (and the bug/feature being present on Flourish as well), the need to keep both Flourish and Slice and Dice active, and the constant target swaps I need to be doing as a tank I constantly face situations where I have only one or two combo points on a target, and am getting ready to swap to another to build up threat. In these situations I would need to:\r\n\r\n1. Check buff durations for Flourish and Slice and Dice\r\n2. Check combo points\r\n3. Estimate whether the remaining duration is lower than what would be gained from casting the ability now\r\n4. Decide whether to cast Flourish or Slice and Dice\r\n5. Pick a new target\r\n\r\nDespite tracking combo points both with visual and audio cues, and having duration bars for both abilities, it is not unheard of that I end up wasting duration from the buffs due to a miscalculation.\r\n\r\nBesides, the issue tracker discussion linked by @imaglcian comes to this conclusion:\r\n> Considering this, I guess there is no \"A More Powerful spell is already active\". **A smaller duration doesn't replace the longer duration but it eats up the combo points anyway.** (Emphasis added by me.)","createdAt":"2023-05-04T00:57:33+0200"},{"author":{"login":"imaglcian"},"body":"This is not a turtle-specific bug, and is however an expected behavior.\r\nWith a little bias, I would like to state that the idea of a \"Rogue Tank\" to me has always seemed like a single-target tanking option (That's what we've gotten tools for only any how), I think your best option is to make a forum post with these suggestions, as it's currently not a bug or unintended feature. The idea of Combo Points already is a single-target thing, and rogues don't have any proper AOE. (Also something that would have to be suggested through forums)\r\n\r\n\r\n**There would be 2 issues however with this proposal**\r\n\r\n* Coding the client in such a way, that it checks for duration left, combo point amount and what finisher has been used, while also prioritizing to _not_ refresh if the duration would not increase would be a lot of work.\r\n* This would also mean, that it could lead to buggy or impeding behavior, say you waste 25 energy + x amount of combo points, because the duration does not increase. (Even if it was \"changed\" to not do so)\r\n\r\n\r\n**The only way to go around this (And as other rogues do), is to either do the following:**\r\n\r\n* _Change_ how finishers work (Which again should probably be emphasized in a forum post rather than here), and make it so you do not lose 25 energy or combo points when using flourish/slice and dice of lower combo-point amounts\r\n* What other rogues (as well as me) do, is to pool energy, which you can do up until 80 energy + 3/4th of the incoming energy tick, or 100 energy if you have not gotten any parries (Meaning you would lose 1-9 energy from the next tick) - This means you don't lose any DPS, but you rather save it to either give more space to the tanks, or to line up your finishers a bit better.\r\n\r\nI would also want to state, that Flourish as is, is already super hard to line up properly with Slice and Dice, due to it's duration being equal to 'Slice and Dice -1 combo point', which effectively renders any proper rotation _useless_. (I have already made a big forum post regarding this and many other things)\r\n\r\nEither way, I don't agree that this should be fixed, just since it would impede every other factor of rogue gameplay (besides tanking), in regards to the examples I posted in my previous comment. (Not being able to refresh Slice and Dice with a lower-point amount, right before the mob dies, and not having to use it for the next mob pull) - You are technically refreshing Slice and Dice/Flourish by using a lower-point amount :)","createdAt":"2023-05-04T13:10:41+0200"},{"author":{"login":"RUTHINAS"},"body":"> Either way, I don't agree that this should be fixed, just since it would impede every other factor of rogue gameplay (besides tanking), in regards to the examples I posted in my previous comment.

What I mean by this report is that regardless of how many combo points it took to cast the initial buff, a buff with more duration _remaining_ should not be replaced by a shorter buff. If a 5-combo Slice and Dice has 3 seconds remaining on its timer, a 1-combo Slice and Dice _should_ replace it with its 9 second duration (untalented). Indeed, the inability to recast or refresh Slice and Dice in such a situation would seriously impede rogue gameplay, but it is not at all what I was suggesting.\r\n\r\nLike I quoted from the previously linked issue tracker conversation in my prior message:\r\n\r\n>A smaller duration doesn't replace the longer duration but it eats up the combo points anyway.\r\n\r\nThis would indicate that the behavior on Turtle is currently bugged.","createdAt":"2023-06-12T02:46:57+0200"},{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"Working as Blizzard intended.","createdAt":"2023-12-09T15:57:18+0100"}],"createdAt":"2023-05-01T01:28:19+0200","number":3367,"labels":"Rogue, Spell","state":"CLOSED","title":"Flourish, Slice and Dice can be overridden by shorter duration versions","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\nUsing Flourish or Slice and Dice grants a buff which varies in duration based on the amount of combo points expended. The strength of the effect is always the same.\r\n\r\nWhen a high duration buff is already affecting the player, they can recast either ability with fewer combo points. This will lead to the duration being recalculated based on the new combo point value, which can shorten the effect by a very large amount (a 5-combo, fully talented Slice and Dice will last 30 seconds, whereas at 1 combo point it will only last 12 seconds. The remaining 18 seconds are lost).\r\n\r\nThe talent Ruthlessness gives an up to 60% chance to gain one combo point when using a finisher. If the player were for any reason to cast either of the two finishers with multiple combo points and then accidentally recast it with the single combo point given by Ruthlessness, they will end up losing valuable time on the buffs.

A quick look through old FC post seems to indicate that threat was being split more times than intended. \r\nI vaguely recall someone testing this and reporting that extra threat was being generated from ally buffed who were not in combat with the target or that some mobs wouldn't receive any threat if they were outside of exp range but I didn't find anything conclusive.\r\n\r\nI also recall someone mentionning that threat was only being split if the targets belonged to the same faction (i.e. if you pulled a red mob and a yellow mob, threat wouldn't be split between them) but I can't find anything substantial on the subject either.\r\n\r\n\r\n**About \"vanilla\":**\r\nHere should be the [webarchive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20061218200637/http://evilempireguild.org:80/guides/kenco2.php) of the original Kenco Guide (date of last edit July 2006) that already mentions `These forms of buffs all have infinite range; they will cause threat to all mobs on whose threat list you are on.

The weapon used has no importance in this test. I specifically used frost oil because it's the only proc effect I know of that has a clear percentage chance in the description, which is 10% ... and multiplied by 30 times via judgement + seal of the crusader should be 300% chance.. so there's no way it should not proc every time when used this way.\r\n\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=3829\r\n\r\nLike geojak also linked there, I also encountered other judgement + seals combinations that had similar issues, but those were less common or just harder to reproduce somehow.","createdAt":"2023-04-20T16:46:39+0200"},{"author":{"login":"geojak"},"body":"I think I onwo what happens here.\r\nYou are using dark iron pulverizer right?\r\nCrsuadee jugment on cc effect weapons is only 6x\r\nThis carries over to enchants and frosoil.

The bonus chance multiplier is calculated based on the weapon. If your weapon has a CC effect, that will also reduce the chance for Judgement to proc any enchants on it like Frost Oil.

To test this I have used frost oil on my weapon which has a 10% base chance to proc. \r\n2.

I then activated Judgement on an enemy entity (test dummy, mob, player, etc) with varied results although it shouldn't be that way according to point (2.). As you can see in the combat log of the screenshot I've provided, It worked the first time , followed by a second time where it simply consumed my seal and nothing happened, followed by a third use of judgement where it worked again.

Sap should break stealth if it Misses.\r\n\r\n@ratkosrb \r\nActually, even though it _does do damage_, Gouge was never meant to break when applying on-hit effects or poisons. This was a concurrent theme on other private servers as well as Classic. My first bug report made on this topic a year ago, and reposted a month ago was on this topic; Incapacitating special abilities should be able to proc non-damaging effects, while every other special ability should be able to proc any effects such as weapon on-hits, and weapon \"enchants\" like poisons, including Feint- Which it doesn't sound like is getting fixed either sadly.\r\nI don't want to overcomplicate my reply by mentioning other known bugs affecting rogues on this server, (example: Stealth at high levels). \r\n\r\n**Here is how I see it**:\r\n- Either gouge should not proc any damaging effects (like the hotfixes have promised), or gouge should not be able to proc any effects at all (prior state, also considered a bug). The argument that it does damage and it being reasonable of breaking wouldn't be valid for 2 reasons:\r\n1. It _only_ does 45 damage\r\n2. It's an Incapacitate, and the damage should be applied before the incapacitate effect\r\n- There have been no arguments disproving the fact that Feint should be able to proc everything mentioned, I have even posted links to clips showcasing examples of it, from both Classic and Nostarius.\r\n\r\nI also want to mention that Sap shouldn't have a \"chance to miss\" and never did until this point (on this server only) but I appreciate having the talent re-implemented and working again. Is there any word regarding my other questions related to this bug report, Gouge / Feint?\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2023-04-21T18:41:48+0200"},{"author":{"login":"imaglcian"},"body":"> Why doesn't your sap trigger my Lightning Shield and pop you out of stealth?

(Check #3097 for clips backing this, coming from private servers, NOT classic- Although there were alot of rogues in classic using Feint aswell to get poison procs up faster.)\r\n- Something that I cannot prove, but poisons proc are still overall lower than classic-era servers, and other private servers. (It feels impossibly hard at times to get a poison proc off, unlike other servers)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n- Video example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdsvx4eJ8hY\r\n\r\n1. Go into stealth with double crippling poison (3-piece T2 and fast weapons with double applications can speed this process up)\r\n2. Keep sapping and keep track of the saps that proc crippling poison.\r\n3. If stealth breaks on one of these procs, you have replicated the bug\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proofs**\r\n- https://youtu.be/-3_FkK_Fsfk?t=65 & https://youtu.be/-3_FkK_Fsfk?t=194 = Perplexity about Serenity proccing off quick abilities like Feint. (Same links as my previous report)\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-3_FkK_Fsfk?t=227 = As Perp mentions, every special ability should be able to proc weapon affects, although Sap was never able to proc damaging abilities, same goes for Gouge.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\n\r\n- With the addition of last years class changes, with the 'Improved Sap' changes, stealth should never break when using Sap.\r\n- Damaging poisons / Effects should *not* be able to be procced off Sap/Gouge -> Deadly Poison / Instant Poison & Lifesteal, Vis'kag and other similar procs. Although for balancing sake, I believe only damaging poison interactions with Sap/Gouge should be fixed.","updatedAt":"2023-04-07T01:29:17+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-04-07T01:29:17+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"imaglcian"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"SabineWren"},"body":"Still bugged after 1.17.","createdAt":"2023-10-04T10:21:45+0200"},{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"I am told avoidance only works with Cat family pets at this moment, if someone can confirm otherwise please let us know here.","createdAt":"2023-12-03T23:33:39+0100"},{"author":{"login":"twowTurtReynolds"},"body":"Related to https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/3638","createdAt":"2023-12-04T00:38:29+0100"},{"author":{"login":"SabineWren"},"body":"> I am told avoidance only works with Cat family pets at this moment, if someone can confirm otherwise please let us know here.\r\n\r\nMy tallstrider has avoidance, but tamed pre-avoidance patch.

The current tradeoff for being able to pull some duel shenanigans isn't worth it and it also ruins the most used PvP weapons (MSA/Perdition Blade).\r\n\r\nThis is is downright horrible overall.

That's the only reason. Same with other skills like Sinister Strike.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sap and Gouge being tied to your MH and them NOT procing effects shouldn't be mutually exclusive - basically they SHOULD *require* a MH weapon, however they SHOULD NOT proc effects.\r\n\r\nBecause if they did proc effects, Sap and Gouge would have \"built-in fail chances\", so to speak. \r\nIf you used any type of DPS poisons, had any type of MH weapon proc, or had an elemental damage proc on your gear (all very common things), you'd Gouge/Sap, and the opponent would instantly be free again. In PvE or PvP, both could often be a death sentence.\r\n\r\nCheap Shot is different because you cannot accidentally break the stun**. Cheap Shot is intended for you to DPS directly afterwards, so if it procced weapon effects it wouldn't be detrimental to the skill's intended use. \r\nRemember: after a Cheap Shot or Kidney Shot - the player will continue Auto Attacking afterwards by default.\r\nAfter Gouge and Sap - they will NOT Auto Attack afterwards, because of course you'd instantly break your CC tools.\r\n\r\nLike, I have been sapping in dungeons and PvP w/ Instant Poison MH for months without issue. I could care less about giving them Mind Numbing instead - I just want the target to be sapped. You can't even remove poisons from weapons, either....\r\n\r\nSo if you accidentally apply Instant Poison, you're just fucked unless you can overwrite it? That makes no sense at all. The game cannot be intended to be played that way. If it is, then the design itself is fundamentally flawed.\r\n\r\nHalf of Rogue's best CC tools not being able to properly work with a bunch of gear, and 50% of the poisons MH, is a huge issue  for both PvE and PvP.\r\n\r\n**((You can accidentally mess up the stun on a Cheap Shot if you have a proc effect that also Stuns, but that is a niche case and not relevant to the discussion.))","createdAt":"2023-04-06T17:57:31+0200"}],"createdAt":"2023-04-04T23:09:21+0200","number":3168,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Sap/gouge/CS/KS/feint and weapon procs.","body":"Previous issue: https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/3097\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, those abilities trigger all weapon procs and poisons, not only non-damaging stuff.

Just like all the armor shattering weapons in the game (rivenspike and bashguuder), then change improved expose armor to the following (max rank):\r\nFinishing Move that exposes the target, reducing it by 2250.

The bots seem to work autonomously, if I understand correctly. The bot is launched and it performs its tasks. Longer, but he also doing it. While a person has to sit and wait fifty seconds while an auction searches for ten pages of cheap linen cloth, this is just an example. And this is only one item that you need to buy or sell.

(Also this does work on other servers)\r\nI'll include a bunch of YouTube links to sources proving the fact it should be possible, aswell as my own testing and some talking in my own clips.\r\n\r\nThe biggest downside to this, which I explain in my own video, is that facing warriors just becomes instantly more unfavored for us, especially Orc warriors. We rely on a certain opener to not get hit at the start, and not get any unlucky stun resists, and ultimately can kite them from the start. With the non-addition of not being able to proc poisons during our openers, and with the melee leeway already being bad enough as it is (See https://youtu.be/d0ofoVFQ8c0?t=45 for more info; I strafe him, and as he strafes back and I follow his pathing, he still gets an intercept off  - This is another bug report within itself, in which i have to gather ALOT more clips for. For now, distract will also be useless on this server - Or Demonic Rune/Sapper/Death Ray batching on CC), this just makes Rogue V. Warrior pretty onesided.\r\n\r\nMy own video (Please note, that Crusdader did NOT proc off sinister strike, the 3rd clip was heavily cut down, but I did about 11 Sinister Strikes=: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57VVfP6Sq8M)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Sap/Gouge/Feint a player target\r\n2. See if weapon enchants like Crusader, Frost Chill OR Poisons like Crippling/Mind-Numbing/Wound OR weapon effects like Serenity proc.\r\n3. If not, then it should be considered a bug.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\nSap/Gouge/Feint, etc. Should all be able to proc non-damaging poisons, weapon effects and enchant effects.\r\n\r\n**Proofs**\r\nAll from WoW Classic.\r\nhttps://youtu.be/kf04RPqMml4?t=55 = Crippling Poison on Sap Proc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/cwtxj-ubudw?t=43 = Crippling Poison on Sap Proc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/xTa9WTGCGaI?t=53 = Crippling Poison on Sap Proc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/xTa9WTGCGaI?t=139 = Crippling Poison on Sap Proc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/8Gy8bydO_Hw?t=11 = Crippling Poison on Sap Proc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/DhWRkCvWovI?t=774 = Crippling Poison on Sap Proc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/RmbyeyhWQIA?t=226 = Crippling Poison on Sap Proc\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmbyeyhWQIA = Crippling Poison on Cheap Shot Proc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/xTa9WTGCGaI?t=53 = Crippling Poison on Cheap Shot Proc\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/RmbyeyhWQIA?t=356 = Crippling Poison on Gouge Proc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/YkCJeCtYzEU?t=103 = Crippling Poison on Gouge Proc\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/xTa9WTGCGaI?t=23 = Crusader on Sap Proc (These are hard to find, as Crusader in itself is a super rare proc already)\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-3_FkK_Fsfk?t=65 & https://youtu.be/-3_FkK_Fsfk?t=194 = Perplexity about Serenity proccing off quick abilities like Feint.\r\n\r\n**From other Private Servers**\r\nFinding clips from private servers is super hard, although I'll say I have enough proofs\r\nhttps://youtu.be/NENsoOaM7xc?t=116 = Crippling Poison on Cheap Shot Proc @ Kronos -> Then crusader proc on auto (Not crippling) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**MOST IMPORTANT NOTE**\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-3_FkK_Fsfk?t=227 = As Perp mentions, every special ability should be able to proc weapon affects, although Sap was never able to proc damaging abilities, same goes for Gouge.\r\nAnd again, not being able to proc crippling poison, makes playing rogue in Battlegrounds feel horrendous. Your main objective in WSG for example, is to keep everyone crippled, lock down healers and keep the EFC pinned. One of your most important objectives, now doesn't work as efficient, as proccing poisons on multiple targets is near impossible like this.\r\n- This would also apply, to say an Enchancement shaman with Windfury; Getting a Windfury proc after an auto-attack, and then the Windfury Proc, proccing the Earthshaker effect - Every ability that works similar to this, should work, so paladin procs that work in a similar fashion, aswell as Frostbite weapon etc. Alot of examples I could fill this post out with. (Just to throw a last example, I'm fairly certain scatter shot should be able to proc improved hawk)\r\n\r\nThis isn't even remotely close to something like the debate about Gouge > Restealth not being blizz-like (Which kind of works anyway)\r\n\r\nThere's alot of rogue stuff that i've complained about, dating back to up to over a year ago, which still aren't fixed/optimized.\r\nThings like\r\n- Weapon procs like I am mentioning now\r\n- Pet aggro in stealth (Although blizz-like, should not be)\r\n- Combo points dissapearing after a new target is aquired, which hinders cleave fights in raids, and also punishes you for missclicks. (Which is also blizz-like, but should not be and was fixed later)\r\n- Also want to note, that stealth values here are abseloutely fucked, which should be buffed to be up-to-par with other servers/clients","updatedAt":"2023-03-28T13:27:23+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-03-28T13:27:23+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Pattsy"},"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-03-27T16:25:40+0200","number":3096,"labels":"Warlock, Quest, Need Replication on VMaNGOS","state":"OPEN","title":"The Completed Orb of Noh'Orahil & The Completed Orb of Dar'Orahil","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\nYou don't have to fight the demon after you get the essence of either the infernal, or the felhound.

I'm aware of the pinned issue #1438, but since it was closed, it seems more appropriate to post a new one, rather than adding more in the comments.\r\n\r\n1. Searching with a leading or trailing spaces yields no results as the spaces don't get stripped before submitting the query. Cf. https://classicdb.ch\r\n3. Sorting quests by \"Level\" sorts the levels alphabetically instead of numerically (https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quests#0+2+3+1).\r\nNote that sorting by \"Required level\" sorts them numerically.\r\n4. Quests listed under a faction page, e.g. Darnassus (https://database.turtle-wow.org/?faction=69) do not contain quest IDs, thus the links to quests don't work.\r\n5. Faction pages, e.g. Darnassus (https://database.turtle-wow.org/?faction=69) do not have a \"Members\" tab, cf. https://classicdb.ch/?faction=69\r\n6. Razorfen Kraul (https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quests=2.491) doesn't show quests as it uses zone ID 491 instead of 1717, i.e. the URL should be https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quests=2.1717 instead.\r\n7. Broken anchor tags on quest pages, e.g. https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=2499.\r\nThe anchor tags for the items listed at the top, as well as for the faction reputation reward at the bottom are set to \"ahref\" instead of \"a href\", making neither of them into hyperlinks.\r\n8. Quest items are shown on the last page, e.g. Red Linen Bandana in https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=116, cf. https://classicdb.ch/?npc=116\r\n10. It's not possible to submit a query with fewer than four characters.

This is not a bug pertaining to a set of specific quests.\r\n\r\nI would think there would be no need to pinpoint anything else.

They do not have a magic wand they can wave and utter \"unshareable quests\" that pops a list up in front of them. They rely on the exact same database you and I have access to, and in order to fix the correct quests with the correct flag, they must make a SQL query for all affected quest IDs.\r\n\r\nThey cannot use a blanket query, otherwise all quests in the game become shareable. Asking the devs to dig through every single Turtle custom quest to fix this is not entirely reasonable, but at the same time, you are right, you as the player are not obligated to do the same. Just know that it means that this bug will not get fixed in the timely manner you may wish. If you want specific quests to be made shareable sooner, it is behoove you to pinpoint the problem quests which would allow a dev to immediately write an SQL query, push it to live, and have it fixed in the next update.\r\n\r\nPlease provide more information if you want anything to come of this ticket.

This is how it works in vanilla and here, including both vanilla and some custom shareable quests such as [The Orb of Kaladus](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40233).\r\n\r\nIn summary, out of the set of all custom quests, those that have provided items (`SrcItemId`) should not be shareable (and already aren't).\r\nOf the remaining quests, probably all should be shareable, given that the player with whom we're sharing it has completed any prerequisite quests.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we could select only those custom quests that have no provided items and no prerequisite quests by running `SELECT * FROM quest_template WHERE patch=42 AND SrcItemId=0 AND PrevQuestId=0`. However, as noted above, doing this would miss quests that should be shareable, but have prerequisite quests.\r\n\r\nThe best option seems to be to select the quests using `SELECT * FROM quest_template WHERE patch=42 AND SrcItemId=0`, and then exclude any quests that should not be shareable. There probably won't be many exceptions, and thus will be a net-positive change.\r\n\r\nGoing through a number of quests on Wowhead, I've noticed that the vast majority of non-shareable quests in fact had provided items.\r\nI haven't figured out which, if any, of the columns in the `quest_template` table mark the quest as shareable. Know that would help me get a better idea on how many false-positives there will be when running the aforementioned query, as I'll be able to go through a lot more vanilla quests and perhaps see the pattern of non-shareable quests with no provided items.\r\n\r\nHopefully this helps.","createdAt":"2023-03-08T15:09:22+0100"},{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"Fixed on the next update.","createdAt":"2023-04-02T18:47:52+0200"}],"createdAt":"2023-03-05T13:30:56+0100","number":2937,"labels":"Further informations required","state":"CLOSED","title":"WoW Turtle custom quests are not sharable","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\nPretty much all new custom quests I've come across are not sharable.

Target Dummies drop no loot whatsoever, none for the engineer or for the party to pick up. I tested this with the regular Target Dummies and the high-level Masterwork Target Dummies.\r\n\r\nThe previous loot tables were accurate to vanilla. The issue was that the dummies were lootable by everyone in the party, and affected by loot rules (group loot, free-for-all, master looter) when they should be lootable only by the engineer that uses them. Now it seems that they have no loot tables at all. This makes using the dummies prohibitively expensive, as previously some portion of the materials has been recycleable.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Use a target dummy, any kind\r\n2. Wait for it to expire or have it be destroyed by damage\r\n3. Observe a lack of loot\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC:\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=2673\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=2674 (untested)\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=12426\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\nThe dummies should have their previous loot tables (containing the same materials used to craft them, along with the occasional drop of a Fused Wiring). They should be lootable by the engineer that used them, and by the engineer only (including the uncommon-quality Truesilver Bar sometimes contained in a Masterwork Target Dummy, which would previously pop up as a loot roll). This should not be in any way affected by loot rules.\r\n\r\nIn case making this fix would take a long time to perform, I believe it would be better to roll back to the previous version in the meantime. I'd much rather go through the trouble involved in pestering party members to loot the dummies and then having them to trade the materials to me, than not having any loot at all.","updatedAt":"2023-03-05T18:03:13+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-03-05T18:03:12+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"AKryukov92"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"Haaxor1689"},"body":"Fixed next udpate","createdAt":"2023-03-04T13:04:24+0100"}],"createdAt":"2023-03-02T15:26:41+0100","number":2924,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Quest Return to Port! grouped with Arathi Highlands quests","body":"Current behavior:\r\nReturn to Port! https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=55051\r\nis under Arathi Highlands category in quest log.\r\nPlayer should \"Report the good news to Pazzle Brightwrench in Sparkwater Port.\"\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nQuest should be in Durotar category","updatedAt":"2023-03-04T13:04:24+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-03-04T13:04:24+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"ConcernedTurtler"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"RUTHINAS"},"body":"1.14 multiplied by 140% is close to 1.6 (1.596).

You wouldn't believe it even if you saw it, but with the same gear, talents and self buffs (arcane intellect, mage armor, brilliance aura, mana shield) as in the previous trial (which ended up at 2 minutes 18 seconds from empty to full), I managed to boost my mana regeneration to 645 per two-second tick. To regenerate my 4500 mana pool, it took only 12 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe first few ticks still remained within the 5 second rule, as I was spamming Arcane Intellect to dump my mana ΓÇô they generated only 615 mana (strangely, this is ~95% mana regeneration \"while casting\", despite my buffs and talents totaling to 60%).\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to approximately 1613 mana per 5 seconds while not casting, and 1538 while casting. I doubt these values would be reasonable even while channeling evocation (which, during this trial, generated a massive 1478 mana per tick, equaling to 3695 per 5 seconds).\r\n\r\nAfter this trial, I did another one with only Brilliance Aura as a buff, doing the other steps needed to replicate this bug as quickly as possible. In less than a minute I had attained enough mana regeneration to fully regenerate my 4137 unbuffed mana pool in 12 seconds. Of note is that the buff applied to party members also ramps up in a similar fashion. A shaman friend of mine who would normally regenerate 49 mana per tick while not casting (or ~123 mana every 5 seconds) gained a massive boost, allowing them to regenerate 145 mana per tick while not casting (~363 mana per 5 seconds).\r\n\r\nI now have made a macro that will with no effort replicate the bug reliably.\r\n\r\nWith the ease of replication and powerful effect affecting both the mage and their party, this bug is pretty much game-breaking.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me directly on the Turtle Discord, as I don't feel comfortable having such a powerful bug out in the open before there has been a chance to fix it.","createdAt":"2023-01-16T23:56:12+0100"}],"createdAt":"2023-01-16T02:14:45+0100","number":2706,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Erratic mana regeneration as Arcane Mage","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\nAfter reaching level 40 and getting Brilliance Aura, I started noticing some strange behavior from my mana regeneration.\r\n\r\nRight away after self-buffing (Arcane Intellect rank 4, Mage Armor rank 1, Brilliance Aura) and dumping all my mana it takes me 2 minutes 18 seconds to regenerate my mana pool of 4500. However, just a few moments prior to this ΓÇô before my previous set of self buffs expired ΓÇô I could do the same regen in only 26 seconds.\r\n\r\nObviously regenerating ~340 mana per 2 seconds as a level 43 mage is not reasonable, and it essentially leaves my mana permanently capped. Actually dumping my entire pool for this initial trial turned out to be a difficult task, since having 60% mana regen while casting, not even Conjure Water seemed to do the trick. Luckily Arcane Intellect rank 4 costs a hefty 945 mana per cast, so I could eventually get rid of it all.\r\n\r\nSo I did a test: standing idle in a capital city with only my own buffs affecting me. Dumping my mana pool (nearly) empty by spamming Arcane Intellect and then measuring the time it takes for me to regenerate everything back to full (4500). The first trial was directly after casting the set of buffs (as explained above) and it took me 2 minutes and 18 seconds to regenerate.\r\n\r\nI repeated the test after 8 minutes had passed, only to get the same 2 minutes 18 seconds result. Again, at 16 minutes, the result was the same; 2 minutes and 18 seconds. Once more a further 8 minutes later, the result was an unremarkable 2 minutes and 18 seconds. Finally, after cancelling the effects of Brilliance Aura and Mage armor, regenerating the entire mana pool took a bit longer at 2 minutes 40 seconds ΓÇô perfectly in line with the fact that Brilliance Aura gives 15% more mana regen.\r\n\r\nSeemingly it is not about the time that has passed since casting Brilliance Aura, but instead some interaction of how I play while Brilliance Aura is active. I used plenty of Mana Shield (which absorbed a lot of damage, consuming large amounts of mana in the progress), Arcane Explosion and Arcane Missiles during the previous set of buffs, as well as consumed one Mana Jade and used Evocation twice, and drank a few bottles of water (fewer towards the end of the buff cycle, as I started noticing my mana regen already ramping up while playing). I also had Mark of the Wild, Divine Spirit and Power Word: Fortitude on me, and Lesser Mana Oil (8 mana every 5 seconds) on my weapon for a good portion of the buff cycle, although I had cancelled them all (except for the mana oil) while timing the 26 second result. I suppose they could somehow still alter the regeneration given by Brilliance Aura.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether the mana regen from Brilliance Aura is to blame, but I don't remember noticing anything like this before picking it up. So far it looks very suspect. It also seems that by recasting Brilliance Aura my regen goes back to normal.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Pick up Brilliance Aura and apply the buff (possibly along with Mage Armor and Arcane Intellect, possibly also some buffs from other classes) \r\n2.

The material costs of crafting them are not negligible, and I can no longer have them left unlooted if I am to sustainably use them. It is a bother for me and everyone I party with, since we all need to look through the dummy remains (usually surrounded by the remains of our enemies, and thus tricky to loot) to see which of us has access to the white items. Then, if that player accidentally loots the items, we also need to set up a trade in which they rummage through their inventory to find all the pieces they picked up.\r\n\r\nThis is made more complicated with the addition of a Truesilver Bar to the loot table. Since this is a green item, every party member can see the loot glimmer, further complicating the process of finding the correct party member to open the loot window so that the engineer can pick up the white crafting materials. The Truesilver Bar also opens a Need/Greed loot roll panel, which adds yet another layer of inconvenience to using the dummies. Further, since the dummies despawn after 5 minutes, I often end up losing valuable crafting materials if the player to whom the loot was allocated to is inattentive, AFK or doing a corpse run ΓÇô all the while I am sitting next to it, watching it despawn.\r\n\r\nAll of these extra steps and the confusion of group members not yet accustomed to opening the dummy remains usually lead to a minute or two being wasted after every single time a target dummy is used. And since I am usually the tank on these runs, it halts the progression of the entire instance for this time. I've already noticed that it is causing frustration in other players, and they often start pulling to speed up the instance run, which ironically leads to target dummies being needed more regularly to save their skin, bogging us down even further.","createdAt":"2023-02-10T09:15:44+0100"},{"author":{"login":"RUTHINAS"},"body":"Now that the previously applied fix to this bug led to issue #2925, which was rolled back, this issue still persists.","createdAt":"2023-03-11T15:11:04+0100"},{"author":{"login":"RUTHINAS"},"body":"@slowtorta Please reopen.","createdAt":"2023-03-11T19:10:57+0100"}],"createdAt":"2022-12-31T08:17:02+0100","number":2640,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Engineering: Target Dummy interacts with group loot","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\nTarget dummies used by engineers can be looted by players other than the engineer who used the item.

It isn't always apparent at first, until the player walks close enough to the intended target to start casting/attacking, but the game gives an \"Out of range\" error. The intended and eventual target need not be close to one another, and the eventual target is not necessarily even in the player's field of vision (as if they had clicked on a unit off-screen). I have gotten the bug with some regularity, estimating around a dozen incidents per month, and it always seems to pick a target with the same name.

It seems like the game is running a /target <name> script behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nIt becomes apparent in instances when a pet class sends their pet to a unit they _thought_ was the target everyone in the group was attacking, and the pet ends up pulling an extra pack by going around a corner to attack a group not visible to the party. \r\n\r\nThis bug seems to pop up every now and then, but I have not yet discovered a way to reproduce it.

Here it only procs when the spell hits target, which weakens the set bonus effect, because 1. shadow bolt sometimes misses or gets resisted, and 2. shadow bolt has a flight time, which is a long delay at max range, and the target can die while the spell is still flying. So with proc-on-hit we get fewer procs than we are supposed to get if it was properly proc-on-cast.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is the matter of critical heals. Right now, the effect doesn't seem to be able to crit at all, based on multiple raid logs. This heal effect, like all other direct heals, is supposed to have a chance to critical heal for 150% of the original amount. The critical chance is supposed to be equal to the caster warlock's critical chance, which is incredibly spectacular on i.eg. Loatheb where the spore makes you crit all the time. This means right now we miss out on a raw 50% boost to the healing effect on the fight where we need it the most.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\nProc behavior:\r\n1. Equip 2 pieces of tier3 on a warlock and find a suitable target at a large enough distance \r\n2. Make sure the target stays at a distance, while you cast shadow bolts (you can use rank1).\r\n3. Open combat log and notice the delay between finishing cast, and the spell landing (if the target is at 30 yard this is easily 2-3seconds, easy to tell apart). When Vampirism procs, it will happen after the spell has landed, never when you finished the cast.\r\n\r\nCrit:\r\nThis is best done checking existing raid logs, particularly on Loatheb. \r\nIf you want to test for yourself, equip every possible crit chance gear, then apply world buffs and loatheb's spore effect. This puts you to 100% crit chance. Then cast shadow bolts until vampirism procs. All of your non-missed shadow bolts will crit, but none of the healing effects will do.\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=28831\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=28839\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?itemset=529\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

Most of these high difficulty quests seem to award only 10% of the expected gold value. \r\nRevMoneyMaxLevel is supposed to be calculated as 6xRewXP. \r\nIn case of over a hundred tested quests on turtle, it seems to be 0,6xRewXP.\r\nSince Jamey's update on the database (ref to my earlier report: https://github.com/slowtorta/turtlewow-bug-tracker/issues/2439), you can now see quest EXP rewards, RevMoneyMaxLevel values, and also the equivalent gold reward on each quest in the database, so this does not require in game testing, though I assure you I have done the quests and the experienced values match the wrongly calculated database values.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40495 >> RewXP 6400 >> 6*6400 = 38400, which is what the RevMoneyMaxLevel should be. But the RevMoneyMaxLevel is only 3840. This translates to 38,4silver instead of 3,84 gold.\r\nMeanwhile, notice this quest: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=4982 has the same 6400 RewXP and the proper 38400 RevMoneyMaxLevel and awards the proper amount of money.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell what makes it so that two quests with the same exp reward have different calculations for reward money. \r\n\r\nThe number of affected quests is probably in the range of hundreds and I definitely cannot link them all 1 by 1.\r\n\r\nHere are a few more examples to give you an idea:\r\n\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=8710 >>This is the warlock AQ20 weapon quest. Same thing 3960 instead of 39600. 39,6 silver instead of 3,96 gold.\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=8702 >>This is the warlock AQ20 cloak quest. Again, 10% of the calculated value is present. One digit off. \r\nThere are 3 turn-ins per class, and 9 classes so this is a total of 27 affected quests.\r\n\r\nNow the AQ40 turn ins: \r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=8662 >>This is the Warlock AQ40 t2,5 helm quest. With 9950 RewXP the expected value is 6*9950= 59700 or 5,97 gold. In reality, the RevMoneyMaxLevel is only 5970 and the quest only awards 59,7 silver.\r\nNote, there are 5 quest turn-ins for each class in AQ40 and there are 9 classes. That's 45 quests total. Pretty sure they all have the same issue. \r\n\r\nHere is an example from the quest chain for Red Scepter shard: \r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=8730 RewXP 9950, same as above. RevMoneyMaxLevel only 5970. \r\nThe entire quest chain behaves the same way, which is like 8-9quests or something.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples for non-dungeon quests from Karfang Hold, a custom turtle quest hub (all of the quests in this hub have same issue, at least 8-10 quests)\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40505\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40506\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40508\r\n\r\nHere are some quests from Sandfury trolls custom area (most of them are regular quests, only one is dungeon)\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40525\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40522 whole chain\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40526\r\n\r\nA random custom dungeon quest from Uldaman https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40129\r\nA random, non-custom dungeon quest from Blackfathom Deeps https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=6561\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the amount of gold players lose to this bug is not small. 5gold per raid quest, 3gold per dungeon quest.\r\nThis is a general issue that seems to affect most dungeon quests, raid quests, and custom turtle quests. To the point this makes it not worth for lvl 60s to quest for gold at all.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

We did have a very high damage group, so I'm highly doubtful of the NPCs dealing more than us, unless they're excessively powerful too (which would then be an issue in its own right).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\nGo to Zul'Farrak, and rescue the NPC group from the Sandfury Executioner using the Executioner's Key. Walk down the stairs with them, clearing the throves of trolls assaulting you from below. At this point it gets a bit sketchy on how to reproduce the bug, but I would assume either letting the NPC group deal more damage than the player group or allow them to make the killing blow on the boss would lead to this happening. \r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=7275\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

This applies also when the warlock runs with Demonic Sacrifice instead of a pet - the pet which was sacrificed is refunded instead.\r\nHowever, usually when I die in a stunlock or my character is otherwise crowd controlled, after dying I get no refund on either shard or pet, which is about 50% of the time. This means I am out of the game for 10seconds to resummon my pet and I lose a shard every time, something which is incredibly difficult to replenish in a PVP situation.

The test fights were all taunt immune, cc immune, and our warlocks did not Shadowburn, we had no druids on Insect swarm)\r\n\r\nAs you can see we did not exceed the 24 slots with high/medium priority debuffs and anything else (any other random dot, deep wounds, fireball etc) are meant to be lower priority effects, and therefore should neither override, nor prevent Annihilator effect. \r\nAnd yet, on almost every fight the debuff was either completely blocked from applying at times, or got removed by something halfway through. It is possible that some lesser dot effects have priority above it here which is not intended. There are very few high priority effects that should be capable of preventing it from applying, so this should simply not be possible.\r\n\r\nNote: other medium priority debuffs don't seem to be randomly removed or blocked. Lock/priest dots run a full duration, ignites only drop when the mages want it to, the crusader strike effect is stacking reliably. This leads me to believe that debuff priorities work in general, only this weapon proc is acting up.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\nThis is pretty difficult to reproduce as every raid comp has different debuffs. First you need to get the Annihilator weapon. Then you make sure your target has fewer than 24 medium/high priority debuffs rolling around and a number of low priority ones. You will see sometimes the weapon proc is blocked and does not apply, other times you are unable to refresh it or it gets clipped off by something.\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=12798\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=16928\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\nAnnihilator weapon proc (armor shatter) should have proper medium priority status, which means it should never be blocked from applying to target (there are 24 debuff slots and way fewer high priority effects that can possibly block it). It should never be overridden by a lesser dot effect (serpent sting, immolate, rend, deep wounds, etc.) and it shouldn't be removed as long as there are equal priority effects with a shorter duration to roll off instead.","updatedAt":"2022-12-10T22:34:19+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-12-10T22:34:19+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":null,"comments":[{"author":{"login":"GitGurky"},"body":"I was unable to reproduce this on a human priest.","createdAt":"2022-12-10T17:32:06+0100"},{"author":null,"body":"RIP, might have a different condition that i didn't notice.

It seems to be patrolling mobs that are the primary culprit; in the Deadmines it is Captain Greenskin and his two adds, in Razorfen Downs it was a patrolling Boneflayer Ghoul.\r\n\r\nThis issue, of course, disproportionately affects hardcore players.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1.

Enter Razorfen Downs and go to the final open area with the spiral mound. Go past the route where Glutton patrols to the northern side of the spiral, on the second layer (just where the first layer starts down below).
