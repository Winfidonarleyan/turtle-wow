This seems to work fine against non flagged targets.\r\nHowever, if your demon gets into close proximity (approx 20 yards) of a pvp flagged player, a pvp flagged pet, or an enemy that a pvp flagged person is fighting, it will behave as though it were set to Aggressive and attack without command. (note this happens regardless of the master being flagged or not)\r\nThis unintentionally flags the master for pvp and can also grief lower level players without intention (i literally have to spam /petfollow to keep my pet off the guys who level in my farm spots)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Enslave a demon or summon an infernal/felguard\r\n2. Approach a pvp flagged enemy player\r\n3. Demon will attack without being given command, flagging you for pvp in the process.

This happened twice in the video.\r\n\r\nTo explain further, the video starts with me out of combat, then I use Enrage, which starts combat as expected and I engage mobs with maggots in them. After all of them have been killed (0:36), I stay in combat, surprisingly. While still in combat, we engage another pack of mobs (1:10), and a few seconds later (1:17), more mobs show up from somewhere. These are probably the ones that got pulled along with the pack at the very beginning of the video, keeping me in combat the entire time. Once all these have been killed, I finally left combat (1:46).\r\n\r\nAfter this, the next two single pulls at 1:58 and 2:13 go as expected, letting me leave combat as soon as the pulled mobs are dead.\r\n\r\nNext pull was at 2:30, and after we killed all those mobs (2:47), I stayed in combat. About a minute later, a bunch of mobs showed up (3:45), and then another Deep Lurker showed up at 4:41. Once we've killed all these, I finally left combat.\r\n\r\nThe mobs in this video are those that are normally in the circular hallway on the floor just above us. My suspicion is that [Slime Maggots](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=8311) have some special aggro rules, being that pulling them, even though they're not hostile, will pull nearby hostile mobs and other maggots. Perhaps those rules ignore line of sight, which then allows pulling other maggots on the balcony above, who then pull more mobs as they're moving towards us.\r\n\r\nAlthough not captured in this video, the same thing can happen when engaging mobs (possibly Maggots) on the balcony, where the mobs from below will be pulled in a similar fashion.","updatedAt":"2023-01-19T17:32:28+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2023-01-19T17:32:28+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"cyaohiri"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"Fixed in the next client update.","createdAt":"2022-12-01T19:46:30+0100"}],"createdAt":"2022-11-27T23:31:11+0100","number":2517,"labels":"NPC","state":"CLOSED","title":"NPC: Voldana","body":"[Voldana](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=81044) has no voice.","updatedAt":"2022-12-01T19:46:31+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-12-01T19:46:31+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"cyaohiri"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"Fixed in the next client update.","createdAt":"2022-12-01T19:46:26+0100"}],"createdAt":"2022-11-27T23:27:50+0100","number":2516,"labels":"NPC","state":"CLOSED","title":"NPC: Niremius Darkwind","body":"[Niremius Darkwind](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=60710) has no voice.","updatedAt":"2022-12-01T19:46:26+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-12-01T19:46:26+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"cyaohiri"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"Can' you please include video proof of the suggested behavior?

This is a problem because people hitting these mobs become pvp flagged and possible to gank while they are questing/farming. At low levels, this puts a risk at hardcore players too, as it could be a method to bait them into flagging. (I have no reason to believe anyone is doing this on purpose right now, but you do get flagged time to time by hitting a mob that shouldn't flag you, which is a huge scare)\r\n\r\nI have tested this via Enslave demon, but I have strong reasons to believe MC and taming can behave the same way as I have encountered sporadic mistakenly flagged humanoid/beast type mobs before.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Enslave any demon type of mob using Enslave Demon\r\n2. Have this demon engage in PVP with a nearby flagged person of the opposite faction. This flags the demon after a single hit.\r\n3. Release the demon from enslave and now he has the FFA PVP flag on its portrait. \r\n4. Run out of leash range and allow him to reset back to full health. Now you have a demon with PVP flag in the middle of a peaceful quest hub.\r\n\r\nThis is most common to happen in the elite demon hub Darkwhisper Gorge, where warlocks tend to run for their lives upon Enslave breaking rather than killing off the difficult enemies, so they leave behind PVP flagged demons all the time. You can usually see a number of those Hederine NPCs flagged.

So it's definitely not there atm.\r\nWhat I've spotted is that DoTs seems to not work well with low values of spell/shadow/fire power since it tends to work in batches of 6 sp for corr, batches of 12 sp for  coa. The system is incapable of raising singular ticks up in power to account for small increases in spell power. Which hurts the lower levels far greater than the higher levels given the distribution of spell power gear and amounts found.\r\n\r\nAs an example of what I've tested, if you had 12 sp the Corruption would raise all of its ticks' value twice by 1, showing 100% scaling. If you have 17 sp, you don't get any boost in output for Corruption; but it should raise 5 of the ticks by 3 dmg and have 1 tick operate at only 2 dmg boost. Meaning at low levels of sp you will waste more of your item budget at these benchmarks, in this example you'd only have 71% scaling on your r3 Corruption.","createdAt":"2022-11-15T18:34:58+0100"},{"author":null,"body":"Ok that makes more sense.

As it's a level 58 quest, at level 60 there's no experience penalty, resulting in the full amount of experience (6,200) converted to money (6,200 * 6 = 37200 copper or 3.72 gold).","createdAt":"2022-11-23T10:54:58+0100"},{"author":null,"body":"It has nothing to do with applying a penalty because it affects same level quests too.

What the healer NPC seems to do here is just heal random nearby targets that are usually some weak troops while the main NPCs are dying.\r\n- Hive'regal hunter-killer is immune to all form of crowd control. This is not intended. The enemy should be fearable, stunnable, etc. allowing DPS players to assist the NPCs that way.\r\n- Helper NPCs have ridiculously long respawn: if you happen to fail the quest by the captain dying, you will have to wait like an hour for the other 2 guys to respawn and there is no point retrying without those as you have 0 chance to succeed. The captain himself properly respawns in just a few minutes.\r\n- Hive'regal hunter-killer disappears when the captain dies: This is also not intended. In reality, the npcs should keep fighting and eventually kill it, regardless of you or the captain having died. This would allow you to complete quest upon the captain's respawn if you release and rezz up (you should get credit as long as the captain is present when the mob is killed regardless of his prior death) \r\nThis is not supposed to be a difficult quest that you must group up for.\r\n\r\nNote: The alliance version of this quest might have the same problems though I have not tested. Alliance NPC for reference is called Hive'Zora Abomination.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\nBe a pure DPS class (lock rogue mage hunter warrior). \r\nPick up quest Field Duty and speak to the horde camp captain (I haven't tested alliance). \r\nThen the Elite Hive'regal wasp will spawn and you will see how quickly he takes out the army of NPCs despite your best efforts to help DPS or throw in bandages (everything else is futile since the mob is immune to every snare)\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=8731\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15620\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15612\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15615\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15613\r\n\r\nAlliance version: \r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=8507\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15449\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15440\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15443\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=15444\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\n- Hive'regal Hunter-killer should have lower health\r\n- Hive'regal Hunter-killer should not be immune to any form of crowd control\r\n- NPC Merok Longstride should heal Krug Skullsplit, Shadow Priestess Shai, and himself as primary targets above the troops around\r\n- NPCs Merok Longstride and Shadow Priestess Shai should have the same 2-3 minutes respawn as Krug Skullsplit\r\n- Hive'Regal hunter-killer should not despawn upon Krug Skullsplit's death. The army of NPCs should finish killing him and if Krug respawns before he dies, the quest should still award credit to the player.\r\n- Quest should be soloable by any class/spec.\r\n","updatedAt":"2023-12-23T15:06:15+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":null},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"8EightySixed6"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"cyaohiri"},"body":"See #2402.","createdAt":"2022-11-07T10:07:22+0100"},{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"Please report such issues via in-game ticket, GMs can fix them right away.","createdAt":"2022-11-07T11:36:01+0100"},{"author":{"login":"usedcars4cheap"},"body":"This node has been moved to an interactable area outside of the rock formation","createdAt":"2022-11-08T02:01:59+0100"}],"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:27:39+0100","number":2404,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Durotar Mining Node","body":"**Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:**\r\n\r\nUnable to mine a mining node in Durotar.

You might think that it's just some weird lag or spell queuing issue and it will discount the Maul rather than the other ability, but no, it discounts neither.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Be a Druid in bear form, with access to Maul and another rage-costing ability, and talented in to Omen of Clarity.\r\n2. Auto attack until you have a Clearcasting proc\r\n3. Wait for a further auto attack to allow yourself plenty of time to set up and observe the bug\r\n4. Queue a Maul\r\n5. Before the Maul goes off, cast a rage-costing ability\r\n6. Observe that you have lost Clearcasting, but your rage has been reduced by the cost of the ability (talent dependent)\r\n7. Wait for the Maul to go off\r\n8. Observe that the Maul has also not been discounted. Note: I wouldn't expect the Maul to be discounted, but this refutes the possible argument that some sort of lag is causing the Clearcasting proc to be consumed on Maul rather than the first ability you cast.\r\n\r\nNote: I only personally tested these steps with Swipe and Savage Bite.

(It causes big problems when we try FD+trap) It's part of a general problem too, when we're out of combat, when we eat to regen, but our pet or the group makes us go into combat, we don't regen anymore, although we continue to eat, normally it doesn't happen. don't go like this\r\n\r\n2) When we execute FD and we rotate the camera to the left or to the right (right click) it lifts us up immediately, except it's not supposed to lift us up, suddenly it produces an entry into direct combat.\r\n\r\n3) The trap is not supposed to have a slight activation delay, it must be instantaneous, even if a war is charging us.\r\nBecause to put you in situation; a trap set in front of us, if a war charges us and at the time to put an automatic attack + a knee breaker (especially if it is end game stuff), it's over.\r\nExcept this is not supposed to be the case and the trap should activate instantly.\r\n\r\n4) Traps can be resisted in pvp, but on the other hand the FD is not supposed to be resisted in PVP.\r\nThe talent point that reduces resist FD is useful for PVE.\r\n\r\n5) to be checked, but it seems to me that our character is totally out of combat when the FD animation ends, which is not advantageous for those who have a long death animation.\r\nNormally we go out of combat as soon as the spell is activated.\r\n\r\nThese are the major problems I encountered on the FD + TRAP.\r\nOf course my expertise is based on wow vanilla of the time, on various sources, memories and old videos, which unfortunately the more time passes, the more they are likely to be deleted from you tube.\r\n\r\nI have other bugs to report for the hunt.

During quest Hunting for Ectoplasm, all 3 types of ectoplasm quest items displayed this behavior at random. \r\n2. The item would drop, and when looted from the target corpse's inventory would disappear as if looted, but no loot message would appear in chat. The player character would then stand as if done looting. However the item would not be in inventory. When trying to loot the corpse again, the loot bag icon would appear (brown if in range, grey if out of range), but no sparkles. The corpse would remain unlootable, despite the cursor icon changing to the loot bag.\r\n3. This behavior only occurred when the Ectoplasmic Distiller buff was on the player. If the buff faded before the mob was killed, then the quest item did not drop as intended.\r\n4. This bug appeared at random, up to 3 times consecutively in some instances. Most frequently observed with Banshees in EPL. At least 7 times during the entire run of the \"Hunting for Ectoplasm\" quest (still not done, took a rage-break to write this since I need to buy more Goblin Fuel to power the quest item).\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC: \r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=12179\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=12178\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=7524\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=7523\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=8541\r\n\r\nItem: \r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=21946\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=21937\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=21936\r\nhttps://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=21935\r\n\r\nQuest: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=8924\r\n\r\nSpell: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=27433\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

This has been tested with two other priests and numerous issues have been found. The first is that the Cleaner will spawn even when he shouldn't. In original vanilla as well as Classic WoW it was completely allowed for a priest to bring another priest friend and a druid to make the quest a bit easier, there are forum posts dating back to 2005 confirming this as well as videos on YouTube \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsupFBgRRQE&ab_channel=Lemur%27sCorner < Just an example of the quest working correctly. We attempted the druid strategy and two priest strategy and both times the Cleaner instantly spawned and attacked us, this is not supposed to happen when the quest is working correctly, at one point 2 Cleaners spawned at the exact same time which I have never seen happen before. Even when attempting to solo the quest, it is impossible as the ground skeletons spawn endlessly when there should only be one group per wave, I had a friend who completed their Benediction quest a few months earlier attempt it on my Priest and they confirmed it was significantly more difficult than when they attempted it and the amount of skeletons spawning was overwhelming. I understand the quest is meant to be challenging but as it stands it's impossible and very frustrating. The pathfinding of the peasants is also bugged, causing them to walk into the sides of the cliffs. \r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Begin the quest with anyone or anything near you (druid strat, second priest strat, mechanical yeti, Barov peasant caller) The quest will either instantly fail or the Cleaner(s) will spawn and kill you. This is not supposed to happen in the vanilla client, you were allowed limited assistance from items/friends in the original client\r\n2. Attempt the quest alone, you will be overwhelmed by waves of skeletons spawning too quickly and too many by the third wave even with plenty of consumables/pots/downranked spells etc\r\n3. Trying to start the quest at all has a chance to instantly fail and spawn the Cleaner to kill you even if you are completely alone\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nNPC: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=14503 , https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=14485 , https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=14484 , https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=14486\r\nItem: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=15778 , https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=14023\r\nQuest: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=7622\r\nSpell: \r\nObject: \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\n\r\nThe Cleaner should NOT spawn solely because there are other players in the vicinity, only if they intervene directly with the player currently on the quest. A druid is allowed to stand still with thorns to tank the skeletons at the entrance of the cave if needed, and a second priest with the Eye of Divinity can offer heals so long as they don't move and don't interact with the player on the quest, assistance items like mechanical yeti and Barov Peasant Caller also shouldn't spawn the Cleaner or fail the quest, these were permitted in Vanilla. Scourge Footsoldiers should only spawn in a single group ONCE per wave, not constantly pouring out every few seconds. Plagued/Injured Peasants should walk in the center of the road and not stray off near the cliffside making it more difficult to track them.

He is excellent while soloing, because he is an excellent tank, is able to keep aggro and has high armor and health. **At higher levels, however, it is unable to hold a mob's attention for very long**.\r\n\r\n3. **Succubus deals the most damage of all the basic minions, without talent upgrades.**\r\n\r\n4. **The Felhunter is your anti-caster minion.** Where the Succubus deals lots of melee damage, the Voidwalker is a great tank and the Imp deals lots of ranged damage, the Felhunter has high magic resist and has abilities to Counterspell, remove buffs from enemies and remove debuffs from friendlies.\r\n\r\nSo warlock minion's are design to be summon for different situation. It's explain why you earn Soul bags at level 20 to be able to swith from minion to minion more often during leveling/dungeon/raid when you unlock the succubus.\r\n\r\nCurrently :\r\n\r\n- Imp has way to much health.\r\n- Voidwalker melee's damage are doubled.\r\n- Succubus deals equals/less damage than voidwalker.\r\n\r\nResulting that there is no asking question for a warlock during his leveling/dungeon, just stay with voidwalker and go on. He deals the most damage of all the basic minions, has the most health, very mana efficient and tank more than good.\r\nNo good reason to spend talent point to improve Succubus.\r\nNo good reason to summon Succubus to speed up your dps/leveling because currently Voidwalker do it better.\r\nImp can tank in some circumstance due to its large health pool.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\nCurrently at lvl 24 I made only tests for Voidwalker and Succubus minion at Apprentice training dummies.\r\nWith no improved minion talents and no active minion spells.\r\n\r\nSummon alternatively Imp, Voidwalker and Succubus and check pet stats values under character info page.\r\nFor more data send it to a practice dummies and read damage meter results.\r\n\r\nImp to much health\r\n![Imp_lvl24_stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56754835/187070983-9cfa4712-45d2-43a5-883a-a224c04b659c.png)\r\n\r\nVoidwalker to much damage\r\n![Voidwalker_lvl24_stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56754835/187071036-a8b5d433-21fe-49ae-8027-8c674d234f1f.png)\r\n\r\nCompare to Succubus\r\n![Succubus_lvl24_stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56754835/187071050-687b395b-b49a-4642-9de3-0eee84c9bc01.png)\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\nSpell : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=688\r\nSpell : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=697\r\nSpell : https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=712\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior.

After standing around in the enemy flagroom and trying (and failing) to stop the efc from capping, I whispered him to ask if their flag was still visible for him, which he confirmed. No Alliance player made it to the Horde base, so I wasn't able to have one of them try to pick it up, so I can't tell if it was truely only on my end or not. I was almost in the tunnel of our own base when I died, so the enemy flag room probably wasn't loaded at the time of my death, if that's important.

It should also be noted that there are many chest spawn locations not currently being used at all compared to Classic (Which from memory is accurate to 1.12, while private servers tend to have always used a more simplified system which can be more easily abused)\r\n\r\nAs seen in the below example for private servers, all of these chest locations in Wetlands are static, they always respawn on a set respawn timer which for this level is 60 minutes from memory.\r\n![Private](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88284400/185337295-8053826f-c966-4370-8f69-df625046bb9b.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn this image taken from Classic however, each color represents a \"Cluster\" of chests, (guessed based on personal testing and memory) all clusters of chests can potentially spawn at the same time, however there should only be 1 chest up per cluster and there should also be far more chest spawn locations when compared to the current private server locations.\r\n![Classic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88284400/185337298-3531931f-beff-4f7d-ae17-c9f690a17fed.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt should be noted this effects every zone and every instance where chests can spawn, instance chests should also have randomly spawning chests based on this system (Stratholme for example should typically have 2-4 chests, with them potentially spawning as locked over roughly 12~ different locations, currently there seems to only be a single unlocked chest  and a single locked chest spawning in the same locations for the whole instance)\r\n","updatedAt":"2022-11-06T01:09:06+0100","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-11-06T01:09:06+0100"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"Kerebrien"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"Sorry, we were unable to reproduce this bug.

It's been killing a lot of HC players and managed to get me too when I knew.\r\nΓÇö It's, I think, very significant / disruptive and basically compromises an entire or most of a zone. That being \"Desolace.\"\r\n\r\n***Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible***:\r\n\r\n1. Enter Desolace with rumors circulating about bugged wind / air elementals.\r\n2. Approach the zone's center from any direction, below the northern-middle ridge.\r\n3. Notice the Whirlwind Shredder(s), air elementals that can / might be seen glitching around the area.\r\n4. Attempt to pass through the area, even giving them a ridiculous distance compared to other mobs.\r\n5. Notice that their effecting aggro radius is exponentially larger because of their tendency to glitch / teleport around.\r\n6. Instead of approaching the player, they teleport to the player instantly. There are (3) or more of them.\r\n7. Strangely, Burning Blade Adepts also aggro and teleport to the player from seemingly nowhere / VERY far away.\r\n8. Now that the player, sometimes hardcore, is fighting (3) or more elementals and possibly orc casters, they'll likely run.\r\n9. While the Whirlwind Shredders ARE faster than a player with 108% speed, they will also not effectively leash / disengage.\r\n10. When the player has run a set distance, they turn away but re-aggro and teleport back to the player.\r\n11. Unless the player manages to kill everything involved, which is exceedingly difficult, they'll successfully attack the player indefinitely.\r\n12. Almost always results in a death sentence for the player unless they're somehow all killed or maybe vanish / feign.\r\n13. It's worth noting that it functioned as a sort of \"trap,\" that the mobs spring on an unsuspecting player; it's like a sequence.\r\n\r\n**NOTE** ΓÇö the character WAS level 37 at the time, paladin\r\n\r\n**IDs of affected creatures, items, quests or spells with a link to the relevant page:**\r\n\r\n***Whirlwind Shredder***: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=11578\r\n***Burning Blade Adept***: https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=4665\r\n\r\n\"*Yes, Officer, it was these guys right here.*\"\r\n\r\n**NOTE** ΓÇö elementals were visibly glitching around in the area north of kodo graveyard\r\n**NOTE** ΓÇö orc adepts were teleporting from an unknown location ( someone said under the map / terrain )\r\n**NOTE** ΓÇö it's supposedly happening in areas of central desolace, and makes the quests in central desolace extremely dangerous\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\n\r\nIf you go anywhere near ( ridiculous range ) these things or really even just central desolace, they'll proceed to teleport to the player upon aggro and every time the leash resets. Each time they \"leash,\" they turn and teleport back to combat with the player until the player kills the teleporting stampede or until they die. Almost everyone dies because if you continue running away, they'll follow you indefinitely. And, they teleport to you and deliver attacks regardless of what you do or however fast you are. Was able to have one successfully leash / disengage after damaging it significantly. However, they just overwhelm you because there are too many.\r\n\r\nAs someone who just died excruciatingly to this, I hope that my firsthand account of it will provide sufficient information / detail.\r\nRespect to the Turtle WoW team for this awesome server and project.

So Travel Form mana cost is still bugged and is too high, it should be 13%.\r\n\r\nAnd also - absence of a complete list of custom changes on web-site/forum or in database makes it very confusing.\r\nIt would be nice have at least something like https://forum.turtle-wow.org/viewtopic.php?t=3334 but with all changes (some changes including \"Bear form mana cost has been reduced from 55% of base mana to 35% base mana in 1.16.1\" is missing there, new ability Savage Bite description is also missing there) and/or adjust database.turtle-wow.org accordingly.","createdAt":"2022-08-14T01:18:06+0200"},{"author":{"login":"Testerrosaurus"},"body":"> but then it seems that by changing Bear Form and Cat Form mana cost from 55% to 35% but leaving other spells base mana cost unchanged - other spells may now cost significantly more than they should.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, besides Travel Form and Aquatic Form (20% to 13%) also not adjusted to tbc values:\r\nBarkskin (15% to 12%)\r\nInnervate (5% to 4%)\r\nRebirth (85% to 68%)\r\nAbolish Poison (16% to 13%)\r\nCure Poison (16% to 13%)\r\nRemove Curse (10% to 8%)\r\n\r\nAnd all of them now cost more in absolute mana values than they should because base mana for characters is higher.\r\n\r\nOr maybe i'm wrong about base mana values in vanilla and them being higher now, but it feels weird to play druid when Travel Form costs that much compared to Bear/Cat (that's what drove me here in the first place).

This NPC is intended to be kited over a long distance (easily verified in many video guides and writeups), typically up a hill and onto the road. When spawned and pulled from the location in the screenshots (58, 21 coordinates) and kited up the nearby hill towards the road, the NPC evades and resets approximately 3/4 of the way up.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110290116/183713675-95b5a695-d0d9-4ea0-8370-8e351ff1da42.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110290116/183724678-15eb6eed-22c5-411a-9d9b-c1d055f7fc1b.png)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n1. As a hunter on the quest \"Stave of the Ancients\", speak to Artorius the Amiable at the given coordinates (58, 21) or that rough location. Landmarks include a small rock formation and small tree. This will cause the spawn of the demon NPC.\r\n\r\n2. Attempt to kite the demon uphill with Serpent Sting rank 8, using Arcane Shot rank 1 on cooldown to maintain threat.\r\n\r\n4.

This actually has nothing to do with netcode and is just an animation issue (and it's not even a bug, just how blizz decided to code it for some reason). The damage happens exactly like expected. Pay attention to the health bar or install a floating damage text addon and you'll see how you actually do damage the first swing despite no number popping up, and in fact you do damage before the animation even starts, the game just delays the number from popping up to make it more cinematic or whatever.\r\n\r\nThat quote is also incorrect as far as I know and even if it were correct it'd have nothing to do with the issue you're describing, you sure that guy wasn't just trolling you?","createdAt":"2022-08-07T18:48:24+0200"},{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"Fixing performance issues is an on-going process.","createdAt":"2022-10-21T23:35:29+0200"}],"createdAt":"2022-08-06T19:28:10+0200","number":1834,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"Combat is \"laggy\"","body":"\r\n1.

The bigger the number on the counter, the faster a player falls until they reach terminal velocity.\r\n- When the counter reaches a certain value, a flag is set to deal a certain percentage of damage to the player when they land.  The longer they're in freefall, the more damage they'll take upon landing.\r\n\r\nThis is all perfectly normal and makes sense.  But then, things get complicated when Slow Fall is castΓÇª\r\n- If the player is under the effects of \"Slow Fall\", the player's **vertical momentum** is locked to a certain value, but the fall speed / fall damage counter continues to increase.\r\n- If Slow Fall disappears before the player lands, the counter tells the game that the player should be falling at maximum speed and makes it happen in an instant.\r\n- Since the \"fall counter\" never stopped increasing, the player also takes more damage than expected from the fall.\r\n( This number that increases while a player is in freefall doesn't appear to have a maximum value, so it's possible for a player to take a truly **ridiculous** amount of damage if they fall for long enough.)\r\n\r\nLooking it up on _Wowpedia_, this seems to be a consistent oversight that's been around since Vanilla and persists clear through to the now.

Complete the Alliance quest \"[A Matter of Trust](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=60070)\" in Goldshire (or)\r\nComplete the Horde quest \"[Red Skies of Durotar](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40298)\" in Razor Hill\r\n2. Ride Kelton's Riding Gryphon (Alliance) or Ride Bristlefur (Horde) and immediately try to move\r\n3. The riding gryphon / wind rider \"mount\" will break and become frozen in place, usually with violent twitching\r\n\r\n**Problem 2:** Flying mount disappears prematurely\r\n1. Follow step 1 of the previous issue.\r\n2. While already mounted, buy another ride on the riding gryphon (Alliance) / wind rider (Horde)\r\n3.

Describe how it should work:**\r\nRegarding **Issue 1**, the flying mount should not get stuck and the player should be able to fly away as soon as they've purchased a ride.  I have no idea why it gets stuck during \"take-off\" when moving.  I just know that hanging back for about a second usually prevents this from happening.\r\n\r\nRegarding **Issue 2**, the player shouldn't be able to purchase multiple rides on the flying mount.  One solution to this would be to make the NPC disappear and reappear akin to [Maybell Maclure](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=251) during the quest \"[The Escape](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=114)\".  That would make it less likely for a player to _accidentally_ purchase two rides.  The other, more recommended idea would be for the NPC to set a temporary flag on the player (if it doesn't, already) and to check the player's status.  If they detect that the player is already mounted, they can refuse service.\r\n\r\n**Related issues:**\r\n- #1577","updatedAt":"2022-07-26T02:02:26+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-07-16T00:00:44+0200"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"login":"JoLiKMC"},"comments":[{"author":{"login":"slowtorta"},"body":"Fixed in the next revision.","createdAt":"2022-07-16T00:00:56+0200"},{"author":{"login":"JoLiKMC"},"body":"For the curious, this was fixed by removing the emotes and replacing it with a \"status\" text message:\r\n\"Dwarven Mild / Mutton Chop required.\"\r\n\r\nWorks for me~","createdAt":"2022-07-26T02:01:41+0200"}],"createdAt":"2022-07-14T13:40:01+0200","number":1577,"labels":"","state":"CLOSED","title":"30-Second Riding Gryphon (Goldshire) / Wind Rider (Razor Hill) Emote Problems","body":"After completing the Alliance quest \"[A Matter of Trust](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=60070)\" in Goldshire or the Horde quest \"[Red Skies of Durotar](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40298)\" in Razor Hill, the player is allowed to pay and use a flying mount for about 30 seconds.  If the player doesn't have the required food item, the NPC plays an emote reading:\r\n\r\n\"The [gryphon / wyvern] recognizes you and doesn't seem to be satisfied.

When said character was a sufficiently high level, I noticed that there was a new recipe available from a trainer: Copper Knuckles.  This recipe has three problems with it.\r\n\r\n- When learning the recipe from a trainer, there is a **two-second cast time**.  If the player moves while learning the recipe, **they are not refunded their spent money**.\r\n(Special thanks to someone on _Discord_ for mentioning the second part.)\r\n- The item requires **a very low amount of skill** to create, meaning that the recipe is **already grey** by the time it's obtainable.\r\n- ~~The item **requires Level 5** to equip, but characters **can't learn Fist Weapons until Level 10**.~~\r\nI made a mistake.  Players can learn Fist Weapons at Level 1 but normally, the earliest fist weapon is found at Level 10.\r\nΓÇô\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n1.

A black cast bar will appear for two seconds before the skill is learned.\r\n4. Once the skill is learned, open the Blacksmithing menu.  \"Copper Knuckles\" will be gray, meaning no skill points can be earned from it.\r\n5.

I'm here to report a bug that seems to have slipped under the radar.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a High Elf character, the characters are equipped with one kind of weapon, but when the character is finalized, they end up with something else.  Which this is largely a \"cosmetic\" thing, there are a couple of cases in the weapons aren't even equivalent to each other.  One weapon model, in particular, also doesn't appear to be in the game anywhere else.\r\n\r\nHere are the weapons that appear in the Character Creator, followed by what the player actually ends up with:\r\n\r\nWarrior\r\n**Scratched Claymore** -> Worn Shortsword, Worn Thalassian Shield\r\n\r\nHunter\r\n**Scuffed Dagger** -> Worn Dagger\r\n\r\nRogue\r\n**Scuffed Dagger** -> Worn Dagger\r\n\r\nPriest\r\n**Blackrock Mace** (?) -> Worn Mace\r\n(The weapon in question _looks_ like a Blackrock Mace.  No other model in Vanilla matches it.)\r\n\r\nMage\r\n**Apprentice's Staff** (?) -> Bent Staff\r\n(The weapon in question _looks_ like the Apprentice's Staff from _The Burning Crusade._  No other model in Vanilla matches it.)\r\n\r\nPaladin\r\n**Scratched Claymore** -> Battleworn Bastard Sword\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:**\r\n\r\n1. Log in to _Turtle WoW_ using the official game client.\r\n2. Click \"Create New Character\".\r\n3. Select \"High Elf\" for the race.  Gender, Class, and Name don't matter.\r\n4. Take note of the weapon in the character's hand, then click \"Accept\".\r\n5. Examine the newly-created character.  The weapon they start with is different from what was shown in Step 4.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior. Describe how it should work:**\r\nSimply put, unless _Turtle WoW_ is implementing some sort of \"This is how your character _could_ look\" system like Retail has, the characters should begin life with the weapons they were displayed with in the Character Creation screen.  And that's it.","updatedAt":"2022-07-26T00:58:10+0200","milestone":null,"closedAt":"2022-07-10T16:28:23+0200"}]
